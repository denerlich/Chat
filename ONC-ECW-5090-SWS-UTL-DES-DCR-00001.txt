1.Introduction
1.1Overview of the RER3 Project
Metrolinx (MX) and Infrastructure Ontario (IO) have selected ONxpress Transportation Partners to enter the development phase of the On-Corridor works project to transform the GO regional rail network with electrification, more frequent service, shorter journey times and a more modernized system for the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. The new train service plan proposed by ONxpress to meet these goals require modification of existing tracks and addition of new tracks at certain locations. These changes may require relocation of utilities (Buried Cables/Ducts/Conduits) from Third Party Utilities along the shared Right of Way, including Canadian National Railway Company (CN).
1.2Purpose and Scope of this Document
The purpose of this document is to provide terms of reference for the relocation of CN utilities across the scope of the Regional Express Rail Package 3 (RER3) project. This document outlines the responsibilities of each party during the relocation process of CN utilities for the ONxpress utility engineering design and construction teams (CJV Engineering and CJV respectively), Metrolinx, and CN stakeholders. This document is to be referenced whenever a CN utility requires relocation due to RER3 project work. The design, construction, and operation and maintenance (O&M) phases of the utility relocations are mentioned in this document; however, the focus of this document is on the design phase. This document should be referenced in addition to the Utility Basis of Design (ONC-ECW-5090-SWS-PWS-EGM-RPT-00003).
1.3Communication Channels
When communication between parties (CJV Engineering, CJV, MX and CN) is required, each party is to provide a direct contact that the communication should go through. If that contact is to change at any point during the duration of the RER3 project, notice is to be given to the other parties three (3) working days prior to the change in contact, or as soon as circumstances allow. Each party is to only communicate with the party directly above/below them in the line of communication below (i.e. if CJV Engineering has a question for CN, the question would be passed from CJV Engineering to CJV to MX to CN and vice versa). The current points of contact for each party as of the creation of this terms of reference are as follows:

2.Design Approach Description
2.1Design Standards
Prior to civil design starting, CN must provide MX with input in terms of applicable civil design standards, sizes of ductbank(s), number of ducts, and any other input they would have on the civil design that is not covered in the general CN design standards. Below is a list of the general design standards documentation that CN has provided to MX at the creation of this document.
Instructions to Excavators for the Protection of Underground S&C Cables 
(April 17, 2017 Version).
CN-IT-IO-3011-00 - CN Fiber Optic OSP Infrastructure Construction Abridged Guidelines (April 13, 2022 Version).
Standard Drawing ADDD 2098 – FP 1-1/4 SDR 11x4 with 0.070” Sheath 
(April 5, 2022 Version).
2.2Project Specific Design Constraints
Design constraints are to be considered by both the civil and cable design by CJV Engineering Utilities and CN respectively. These design constraints include:
CN and Bell/360 cables need to be on opposite sides of the tracks to create redundancy in the network.
CN ducts need to be at a minimum 0.6m horizontal offset from ONxpress cable containment.
CN ducts need to be at a minimum depth of 1.2m from proposed surface to the top of the duct bank.
Additional design constraints will apply that are to be in the design specifications provided by CN to MX prior to ONxpress starting the civil design (refer to Section 2.1).
ONxpress to provide space proofed relocation alignments for each corridor based on ONxpress project designs that are to be referenced for CN relocation designs.
2.3Design Process Overview
Identifying a conflict between a CN asset and proposed RER3 design will initiate the CN design process. It is the responsibility of all parties to report through the proper channels when a conflict has been identified. CN must provide accurate existing utility information to CJV Engineering Utilities through MX to facilitate the identification of conflicts. CJV must provide accurate Subsurface Utility Engineering (SUE) data to support conflict identification. 
A flowchart of the design process can be found below, outlying which steps are required during the design process and who has responsibility over each step. The design process covers the relocation of existing assets on a like-for-like basis to the current standards (no enhancement or improvement in level of service).  Any enhancements or improvements to level of service require commercial negotiation and agreement, outside of this design process.





  

















	




*The 90% Technical Review Process follows the same process but includes CN providing the 90% cable design 
to CJV Engineering Utilities (through MX) for review and CJV Engineering Utilities providing comments back to CN.
2.4Agreements
2.4.1Consent to Design
Prior to CJV Engineering Utilities starting the civil design for any CN conflicting assets, an agreement must be reached between CN and MX as to the necessity, scope, and schedule of the relocations. The need for a CN relocation will typically be identified by CJV Engineering Utilities, at which time CJV Engineering Utilities will initiate the CN approval process through the proper channels outlined in Section 1.3. Upon the request for a Consent to Design agreement from MX to CN, CN will have thirty (30) working days to review and accept or provide comments on the agreement. Upon approval of the Consent to Design, CN will provide MX with input on the design in terms of applicable civil design standards, sizes of ductbank(s), number of ducts, and any other input they would have on the civil design that is not covered in the general CN design standards (refer to Section 2.1). Once CN has provided their input on design, MX will also consult with CJV Engineering Utilities (through the proper channels) to determine an estimate for materials needed for the relocation work and will issue a purchase order for CN to review.
2.4.2Shareholder Rights Plan (SRP)
The Shareholder Rights Plan (SRP) is a legal document between CN and MX that outlines the responsibilities, cost allocations, and risks of each party. CN and MX are required to agree upon the SRP prior to any design work starting.
2.4.3Approval in Principle (AIP)
Approval in Principle (AIP) is an agreement that is created by ONxpress CJV outlining the high-level work involved in the CN relocations and the responsibilities of each party. Once created, the AIP is sent to MX for approval and sign-off. 
2.5Technical Design and Review Process 
Sections 2.5.1 through 2.5.7 outline the design technical requirements. Section 2.5.8 outlines the Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Safety (RAMS) requirements.
2.5.1ONxpress CJV Engineering Utilities Civil Design
The ONxpress CJV Engineering Utilities team will have responsibility over designing the civil structures as part of the CN relocation process. Prior to starting on the civil design, the applicable agreements between MX and CN must be in place as outlined in Section 2.4. Additionally, CN is to provide CJV Engineering Utilities (through the proper channels) with design inputs such as applicable civil design standards, sizes of ductbank(s), number of ducts, and any other input they would have on the civil design that is not covered in the CN design standards (refer to Section 2.1).
Once the approvals outlined in Section 2.4 have been executed and design inputs have been received from CN, CJV Engineering Utilities will begin the civil design. At the preliminary (30%) design stage, CJV Engineering Utilities will submit the design to CN for 30% Technical Review. It is noted that the 30% civil design is approximately equivalent to the ONxpress “Design Development Definition (DDD)” level of design development.
2.5.2CN Cable Design
Once the preliminary civil design has been approved, CN (or an approved third-party designer contracted by CN) will begin on the cable design based on the information received in the 30% (DDD) civil design. 
2.5.3CN Tenant Cable Design 
It is the responsibility of CN to organize, coordinate, manage, and direct their tenants, to ensure that the design, design review and construction is coordinated to the same schedule as CN-owned assets. 
2.5.4Coordination Between Civil and Cable Design
Coordination between CJV Engineering Utilities and CN (or CN contracted third-party designer) will be required during the civil and cable design processes. This coordination will include periodic design workshops hosted by MX (CJV Engineering Utilities, CJV, MX, and CN to attend) to review the civil and cable designs together and ensure the designs work together. The frequency of these coordination meetings will vary based on the complexity of the design location; however, they are to be held at minimum bi-weekly during the design phase of the relocation process. At the coordination meetings, a date will be agreed upon between parties present to complete the 90% civil and cable designs and start the 90% Technical Review process. It is noted that the 90% civil and cable designs is approximately equivalent to the ONxpress “Construction Document Submission (CDS)” level of design development. 
Design coordination may also include considering assets of tenants using the same CN infrastructure. It will be the responsibility of CN to notify any tenants using their assets of the relocation and any disruptions that may result due to the relocation. The baseline expectation is that tenants will continue to be a part of the new duct arrangement and that the new civil design should provide an equal number of ducts in the relocated ductbank(s) for tenants. However, in the event a tenant does not want to occupy a duct in the relocated ductbank, a separate coordination effort will be required followed by a feasibility investigation to determine possible space constraints and the ability of accommodating another utility in the rail ROW.
During the design process and coordination, if locations are identified that require asset relocation outside of the rail ROW, it is the responsibility of CN to coordinate with appropriate stakeholders for coordination and permitting.
2.5.590% (CDS) Civil and Cable Design Technical Review
At the time that 90% (CDS) designs are completed for both the civil and cable, the 90% Technical Review process will be initiated. This Technical Review will consist of: 
CJV Engineering Utilities reviewing the 90% cable design.
CN reviewing the 90% (CDS) civil design.
CJV and MX reviewing both designs to provide comments as they deem necessary.
Each party will have thirty (30) working days to review their respective designs and provide comments. Once the deadline for comments has passed, CJV Engineering Utilities and CN (or CN contracted third-party designer) will have ten (10) working days to address the comments and resubmit the designs for review. The review process will continue until all parties are satisfied with the designs.
2.5.6Issue Civil and Cable IFC
Upon completion and approval of the civil and cable designs, the Issued for Construction (IFC) civil design will be submitted by CJV Engineering Utilities to CN. CN will provide written approval stating that the designs are approved to move on to construction. At this time, the design responsibilities for CJV Engineering Utilities will be complete, and CJV will take the work completed by CJV Engineering Utilities forward into construction. These IFC designs will be shared by CN with applicable shareholders and tenants for their information on the relocation. Any changes to the civil and cable designs during construction must be submitted, reviewed, and written approval provided by CN and CJV Engineering Utilities prior to installation.
PEO (Professional Engineers Ontario) Authentication for the IFC Civil Design will be completed by CJV Engineering Utilities. Authentication of other aspects of the design shall be completed by the party responsible for that element.
2.5.7Design Process Summary
Table 3 outlines the design process described in this section and includes anticipated minimum timelines for each step in the design process. The anticipated timelines listed are intended to be a base schedule that may be subject to adjustments depending on the complexity of the relocation that is being designed for and timelines required for CN to coordinate directly with their tenant stakeholders. The timelines listed are to complete the work for a single construction stage.

3.Construction Approach Description 
This section outlines the construction approach for CN relocation activities. 
3.1Preconstruction Activities
This section outlines any pre-construction activities that are to be completed before construction work is to commence. These include:
Material Procurement: At the time that utility agreements outlined in Section 2.4 are approved by MX and CN (prior to the civil design starting), MX will issue a purchase order to CN for review. If that purchase order is accepted by CN, CJV will begin the material procurement process. This purchase order is to be issued at such an early stage due to the lengthy material lead times that are anticipated. 
The quality of material supplied by MX contractor is subject to review and acceptance by CN if not supplied by a CN approved material supplier and/or if the material does not meet tolerances/specifications. CN has the right to reject poor quality material that does not meet quality requirements.
A secure equipment and material storage location with adequate space and access will be identified so that any construction related equipment/material are safely secured and easily accessible.
Contracting of Civil Sub-Contractors: Proposed civil sub-contractor qualifications are to be submitted by CJV to CN for approval. Only select vendors will be considered at CN discretion.
Embargo and Brown-Out Period Confirmation: Prior to construction, CN is to confirm with MX and CJV the schedule for embargo and brown-out periods. These time periods shall be clearly indicated and confirmed in writing. During these periods of time, no work is to take place within 2m of any CN asset. These periods are to be reflected in the final construction schedule.
Detailed Schedule, Work Plan and MX Permits Submitted: CJV is to provide CN with a detailed schedule, work plan, and obtain required MX permitting prior to construction. Detailed schedule must include target milestones and identifying relevant embargo and brown-out periods.
Permitting Received: If any relocations are required outside of the Rail ROW that require permits, they are to be applied for and accepted prior to start of construction. The permit approval process is expected to take anywhere from several weeks to several months (up to 6 months) based on the complexity of the work and entity that the permitting is with. It is the responsibility of CN to ensure that permits are approved ahead of time from the respective stakeholders and are valid at the time of construction.
Training Completed: All personnel working on railway corridors will have to be trained for rail construction safety and be familiar with working on railway corridors prior to working on the site. Any specific orientation/training required by ONxpress will have to be completed before commencing construction. Required PPEs are to be identified and procured ahead of time and worn at all times while within the construction area.
3.2Start ONxpress Civil Work
Once all preconstruction activities have been completed, the following civil construction items will apply:
Civil construction is not to commence without explicit written approval from CN.
Civil Construction is to be performed in accordance with CN standards and best practices.
Failure during construction to follow CN standards and best practices will result in suspension of the work until a remedy acceptable to CN is confirmed.
CN in their sole discretion (acting reasonably) can issue stop work orders when work is taking place on CN infrastructure.
No work is to be performed by a MX contractor at tie-in points or on live cables.
The construction plan is to be executed in accordance with the MCA documenting MX and CN commitments in regard to engagement.
Construction is to be performed in accordance with FOA supplemental agreement.
3.3Civil Construction Completion

Engineering representatives from both CJV Engineering Utilities and a CN Engineer-in-Control (EIC) are to be present on site at periodic and sufficient times during construction to witness proper installation that follows the IFC drawing design. At the time that the civil construction is complete, proofing of the ducts is to be performed by CJV with a CN EIC present. Proofing records are to be supplied to CN demonstrating passage of an 80% mandrel without obstruction.
3.3.2Civil Record Drawings
Civil Record drawings are to be provided by CJV to CJV Engineering Utilities, MX, and CN within 90 calendar days of completion of civil installation, or prior to commencement of splicing (whichever comes first).
3.3.3Handover Process to CN
Once the construction inspections have been deemed acceptable and record drawings are provided by CJV to all parties, the civil assets will be handed over to CN for the cable jetting/pulling work. If CN wants the cable jetting/pulling work to be completed by CJV, written approval is to be provided by CN and the following conditions are to be met:
CN is to procure and supply the cable to CJV.
MX is to pay CN for the cable material procurement in accordance with the terms of their agreement.
Jetting is to be performed by a CN approved subcontractor under the direction of CN for timing and scope. CN is to provide CJV with a list of approved sub-contractors.
Cable testing is to be performed with results provided to CN prior to CN splice crews attending site.
No contractor working for CJV is to open or work within live structures.
CN will not consider any splicing work to be performed by MX or approved sub-contractors contracted by MX.
3.4Abandonment of Existing Utilities
Abandonment of any cabling within a CN owned cable containment structure will be the responsibility of CN. Abandonment/removal of CN civil structures can be conducted by CJV at the written request of CN. All abandoned utilities will be designed as abandoned in place utilities unless specified by CN. All abandoned conduits will be plugged and infrastructure such as vaults and manholes will be filled with compacted sand unless directly interfering with new construction.
3.5Cable Tie-in/Cut-over, Testing and Commissioning
Cable tie-in and cut cover works as well as testing and commissioning of services to be within the scope of CN. MX and CJV will not be involved during this phase.
4.Operation and Maintenance 
Operation and maintenance of the relocated CN assets is to be the sole responsibility of CN.
