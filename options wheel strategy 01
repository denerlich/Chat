okay welcome everyone hope you're all doing well great to see a few familiar names here a few new names as well so just give me a quick hi in the chat uh let us know where you're calling in from and we'll get stuck into today's content we should go for about an hour or so um could be more could be less depending on how many questions but just a quick reminder that everything discussed is for educational purposes only is General in nature and do not take into account your personal circumstances so for those who don't know me a little bit about me I started trading options in 2004 which makes me feel pretty old now um that's me and my wife Alex there and my daughter Zoe who is now 15 and I got a son Jake as well who's 13 um been teaching options since 2010 so that was when I founded options trading IQ so I've been doing this for quite a long time now also worked for 10 years in the hedge fund industry for those that don't know I lived in the Cayman islands for 10 years working in the hedge fund industry which was great fun um and now back in Melbourne and spent thousands of hours researching trading and teaching options so quick outline of what we're going to talk about today well we're going to start with setting a good foundation and talking about how to find trade ideas and some of the tools that I use we'll do a little bit of technical analysis using moving averages and money flow we'll talk about how to get good fills on your trades then we'll look at the actual process of selling cash secured puts which we can also then turn into the wheel so just give me a quick yes or no if you've heard of the wheel strategy before we'll do a bit of a deep dive into option Delta as well uh probably won't go into too many of the other Greeks but we'll definitely need to have a good understanding of Delta for doing cash secured put so we'll talk about that as well and then we'll get some uh examples going as well all right so the first tool I want to share with you is just stockcharts.com um I don't have a paid subscription here but this is what I use for charting other people might have other uh platforms that's fine but basically I try to keep it pretty simple I've got three moving averages the green one is a 21 day the blue is 50 and the red one is the 200 day if those are all nicely stacked in order like this chart is they're all trending upwards and to the right that's bullish if they're trending down to the right that's bearish so try and stick to stocks trading above that 50-day moving average we can see here with this one um really nice uh breakout here then a little pull back to the rising moving average that's a really good um sign there had a bit of a big dip here down to the 200 but um nice looking chart there couple of other indicators I've got RSI up the top talk a little bit about RSI Divergence and things like that uh this one's called accumulation distribution and this one's money flow index so if you go to settings here um there's the moving averages then I've got RSI above the chart accumulation distribution and money flow below these ones basically just tell us is money flowing into or out of the stock and and what we want to see if the Stock's trending upwards and I like to say price action is always the primary indicator so that's the actual candles this top section of the chart are we putting in higher highs higher lows are the moving averages trending upwards that's our primary uh source for technical analysis and then things like RSI accumulation distribution and money flow are what we would call secondary indicators so ideally you want them lined up together so you want your primary indicator of price action aligning with the secondary indicators which it is in this case the stocks trending higher and we're seeing a nice increase in the accumulation distribution line and the money flow line is quite strong as well what we don't want to see is if a Stock's trending higher and the accumulation distribution line is going lower that can indicate that people are there's distribution going on and people are selling into the rally um so there they're getting rid of their stocks on any any strength um in this case these lines are both staying fairly strong so the trend is looking pretty good then we can look for things like Divergence I think meta is showing a little bit of Divergence at the moment so here's a good example where it's in a bit of a choppy Trend it's been in a it's had a huge run in the last two years but the last six months or so it's been a little bit choppy and here we'll just draw some lines on here the stock sort of made an equal high and you can see here if we draw a same trend line on RSI it's kind of trending lower so it's gone from there to there and the accumul accumulation distribution line is also going lower now the money flow index is going slightly higher so there's not full confirmation on all three indicators but two out of three is pretty good I tend to put a bit more weight on the accumulation distribution indicator as well so that's telling me we've had this big rally here but the strength of the rally isn't as good as it was back here there's been a bit of distribution happening um people have selling into this rally okay so that's one little thing that I would look for that was a nice little short there on meta uh for the last couple of days and that's basically it keep it pretty simple don't need hundreds of indicators um the other thing you can do with stock charts is get a what's called a candle glance View and I'll share this link with you in the webinar chat so you can go and look at that for yourself so this will be under these pre-defined groups um Dow stock so these are some of the most highly liquid stocks in the US um some of the best stocks for trading options and we can just have a really quick look we've got we're sorting by RSI so we've got the most oversold at the top um Intel there's had a pretty bad run so deeply oversold uh Microsoft a little bit oversold so this is going to be a good way to find Blue Chip companies that have had a bit of a bad run and they might be um a good little value play you've also got a 50 and a two is it a 5050 I think it's a 50 and a 200 day moving average so the blue one's the 50 the red one's the 200 you can get just a quick look of you know Goldman's obviously in a nice uptrend JP Morgan's in a nice uptrend um Coca-Cola as well uh see Mark has a raised hand if you got a question just type it into the chat um and then you can so that's the Dow stocks and then you can also do your own set Unfortunately they only allow you to have 12 stocks but you can basically just put your 12 in here here and you can have a look a quick look at the 12 main stocks that you might be interested in so that's a nice little way to kind of keep a quick eye on the market uh another tool I use is Market chameleon again I only have a free subscription here but this is a good one for checking earnings dates um so we've got Nvidia here reporting earnings on the 28th after the market close and we've got an expected move of about 11.2% up or down so this is important information when a Stock's coming into earnings and and it will give us uh with a free account it'll give us the last three results as well what the uh expected move was or the implied move and this is the actual move so that's a nice little tool for monitoring earnings dates probably won't get into vix term structure too much today but vix Central is a good one that you can monitor as well um again all free finis also free they have some really nice um I'm monitor the Futures on here but they also have some nice um stock screeners as well got a couple of simple scans here for large cap stocks that are above the 50 and above the 200 day moving average so that's a way to kind of find some strong stocks um and then you can sort of hover over the ticker and you can get a quick little preview of the chart as well so that is a nice little tool as well one of the few paid tools that I recommend is bar chart it's about $20 a month um this is how I find a lot of trade ideas I'll look for for example stocks Crossing uh above or below a 50-day moving average um large cap stocks so a lot of sell signals today so a lot of stocks breaking below 50-day moving averages um if I filter by call volume I'll get sort of the most liquid stocks and then from there I'll go and drill it down and look at the actual chart and see if it might be a good chance for making trade see that it's breaking below the 50-day moving average all right now in terms of getting good fills we want to stick with highly liquid stocks so let's look at a quick example of Apple let's say we were going to sell some puts on Apple we use uh an let's say an 18 Delta see the bidas spread there is pretty tight dollar 56 to1 61 we can probably get filled pretty close to the midpoint there um open interest of 18,000 volume for the day of 954 so really easy to get filled on that put sale at a good price if we look at a different stock that's a reasonably popular stock but it's not great for trading options try and find a similar Delta about an 18 Delta so there we go you can see there only 13 contracts traded for the day and only open interest of 50 and look at the wide bit R spread 665 to 1090 so we want to definitely avoid stocks like this uh hey Robert this is interactive brokers uh my broker platform so avoid illiquid options like this because you're going to suffer what's called slippage which is basically not getting filled at the midpoint midpoint of the spread you might try and sell that option for 880 but you might only get filled at say $850 and all of a sudden you're down $30 in the trade before you even get started okay so definitely avoid ones like this uh why the 18 Delta I just was an example um I just sort of picked one at random um we'll get into that when we look at some actual cach secured puts okay any questions so far all right so let's talk about the actual process of doing cash secured puts now that we know a little bit about how to find trade ideas and the tools getting good fills so why would we trade cash secured puts it's similar to a covered call strategy we'll have a look in a minute it's actually a little bit less bullish than a covered call strategy um and there are some slight differences in returns which is quite interesting you might um find something you didn't know about when we compare cash secured puts and covered calls it's a longer term strategy with potential for monthly income or you could even have weekly income if you're going to be a bit more active and we'll look at some examples shortly and talk about when and why why we might use weekly options versus monthly options it allows you to buy stocks for Less so you can sell a put below where the Stock's trading if the stock comes down and you get filled you're buying it at a lower price than what it was previously trading at and it's a good idea to have strict trading rules to try to avoid big losses and we'll go through some of those as well so this is the wheel flow chart it might look a little bit confusing but it's actually fairly simple so we start off at step one we find a stock that we like and we sell a put option we won't get into strikes or Deltas or anything just yet but we sell a put option if the stock goes up that put expires worthless we keep the premium the option gets taken out of our account and we can start again on the same stock or we can move on to a different stock if the stock goes down we get assigned so now we own 100 shares of the stock and effective or net cost basis or our purchase price break even price is the put strike less the premium received now at step two we want to sell a strangle says straddle but we actually want to do a strangle so we want to sell a call above where the Stock's trading so that's a covered call based on the 100 shares that we own we want to sell another put as well and we're going to take ownership of 200 shares if we need to if the stock keeps dropping after we've done that if the stock goes up and finishes above our sold call strike our 100 shares get taken away our put expires worthless and we're left with a flat position again and we've collected three lots of option premiums plus any dividends that have been paid while we've been holding the the stock if the stock continues down and goes down below our second put strike we're going to get assigned on another 100 shares we now own 200 shares and we're kind of dollar costing average dollar cost averaging into our position we're buying at a lower price reduces our net cost basis we've also collected three lots of option Premium Plus any dividends okay so now we move on to phase three is where we sell two covered calls against those 200 shares and we just keep selling those calls until eventually the stock goes up through the call strike shares get called away and we can start again now there is a little bit of flexibility in these um in the process for example if the stock has had a really big decline at step three we may want to hold off on selling covered calls and we might want to wait for the stock to recover back up towards our net purchase price before we start selling covered calls whenever we're selling a call we always want to do it above our net cost basis we never want to sell below our cost basis because then if we do get our shares called away we're actually getting them called away at a loss but you can see at this point by stage three if those calls expire worthless we've collected five lots of option premiums plus dividends we've got the first premium from selling the put here we sold a put and a call and here we've sold two calls so one another two is three and another two is five lots of option premium so you can see how over a extended period of time we're generating quite a lot of option premium and dividend from our underlying stock position now the other thing that you can do um at phase three if the stock does go up through your call strike but you don't want to have the shares called away you want to hold on to them for the long term you can actually just buy the call back to close but um and I'll show you a couple of things to keep an eye on terms of early assignment you might buy those calls back at a slight loss in order to hold on to your shares reasons you might want to do that is because if you've made a decent profit on the shares you might not want to sell them and Trigger um capital gains tax right and if you buy the calls back at a slight loss that can actually help reduce your taxable income because you're taking a loss on the a realized loss on the calls and you're still keeping your underlying stock position um yes plus three and plus five PR means premiums so one option premium here another two option premium here is three and another two option premium here is five premium and you can get even more if if the stock stays below your covered call it's phase three and the call expires worthless you can sell another two calls and just continue on couple of examples to go through um and this will sort of illustrate the power of this strategy so this was one on ewz the stock started at 3277 sold the initial put at 31 that got assigned sold a second put at 25 they both got assigned so my net purchase price was 28 um stock had gone all the way down to 22 you can see here at this stage uh 18th of September when I was assigned the 200 shares I didn't actually sell any calls yet I waited for the stock to recover a little bit and it wasn't until March the following year when I started selling calls again at that 28th strike which was my net cost basis so sold some more puts here I was willing to go to sort of three or 400 shares um so selling more put selling calls eventually um they got called away at 2850 you can see over the life of the trade the stock went down initially and then recovered ended basically where it started so the stock has gone down 0.06% basically flat I've made a return of 1590 or about 20% in about a year and three months so that's the power of the wheel strategy even though the stock has been flat over that time period I'm up 20% now that doesn't mean I wasn't sitting on on unrealized losses when the stock was here or the ETF but I was pretty confident it was going to recover and you just have to play the waiting game at this point and act in actual fact the return was probably slightly higher because I haven't included any dividends here holding the stock for quite a while about a year so there would have been um some dividends there as well all right the next example is one I like to share because it's a pretty extreme example it's probably about as bad as it could possibly get with a wheel trade um I guess it could get worse because the company could go bankrupt so you've got to be careful of that as well it's why you want to try and stick to Blue Chip companies and particularly ETFs as well are great because generally ETFs are not going to go to zero right so this was a tough trade but it worked out well in the end I was in a massive hole but worked my way back ignored or didn't have any sort of stop loss in place so a good little lesson for you there um but it did work out okay in the end finished with a 20% return compared to the stock going down 42% so I won't go through this in detail again there's a little bit of flexibility here in terms of when I'm selling puts and calls and all that sort of stuff don't worry too much about the details because there's a lot of detail here but basically the main thing to look at is when I started this wheel trade GE was at 32 and it did take 2 and a half years to play out so I started in a 8 ended in December 2010 in a pretty big hole here when the stock had dropped from 32 down to 8 but it kept buying shares selling puts selling calls collecting dividends and you can see here the Stock's gone down um 42.7 1% from basically 32 down to 1830 and I've ended up with a gain of 1,800 so I'll provide the slides you can look through those details if you want um in your own time one rookie mistake that I see a lot of people making is getting sucked in by high volatility stocks yes the premiums are nice and juicy but they're juicy for a reason and that is risk don't get me wrong cash secured puts can work on high volatility stocks but you need to know what you're getting into be prepared for a bumpy ride and even just in the last few years with the the co drop um the the November 22 drop you know some growth stocks and high volatility stocks were down 60 70% so yes the premiums are really high but they're high because the stocks are high beta High volatility and they can have these massive moves I'm not saying don't do it I'm just saying understand what you're getting into um and make sure it fits your risk profile for me I don't want to be doing those High volatility highrisk stocks anymore I do a lot of ETFs now you know you could do this on the q's or SP y iwm you know any of the sector ETFs I really like the country ETFs um plenty of options out there if you don't want to do individual stocks another good tip is to stick to stocks above their 200 day moving average throughout history stocks that have had big declines have done so when they have been below the 200 day moving average a lot of fund managers have um specific rules and Covenants that they can't invest in stocks that are below a 200 day moving average so if a stock breaks below a 200 day moving average it can really lead to a lot of selling um and you can see here the S&P 500 the big declines the two big bare markets that we had we had the initial break through the 200-day moving average a counter Trend rally to retest and once that moving average started to turn downwards and the stocks were struggling to get above it that's when the big declines happened same here we had a bit of noise here around the top um broke through the 200 here and here but it wasn't really until the 200 a started to turn lower and stocks remain below retest and and a fail at that level you know that's when the big declines happened so just keep that in mind uh question here from Dave do I differentiate between High Vol stocks and a High Vol Market yeah definitely I mean a great time to do cash secured puts is when volatility is high in the in the overall Market but I would still stick to um low beta stocks which are generally going to have low volatility but that's when the the concept of um IV percentile comes in so you know you might look at a stock like fisa and that might have volatility of say 30% which is really high for that particular stock whereas for a stock like Nvidia volatility of 30 is really low for that particular stock see if you raised hands has anyone got any questions on that just let me know just type it into the chat um so we'll look at some key differences um with those examples as well in a second all right so let's go and look at some examples right now actually so we're going to look at two examples first one one's going to be a high volatility stock pltr one we looked at earlier now we're going to look at a weekly we're going to try and now I'm going to use a 35 Delta no particular reason just to try to keep it consistent we're going to look at a more or less a weekly trade we'll look at a 50-day trade haven't got a 35 Delta but I'll use 32 and then we're going to look at um that'll be about a 6mon trade all right so if we were to sell that put option let's just hide these two for now we're going to receive about $70 in premium we're going to be on the hook to buy the stock at 30 if it drops below that price now this is a risk Navigator uh part of interactive brokers I always look at this when analyzing any option trade now there's plenty of other pieces of software out there um but I really like Risk Navigator and interactive brokers it's a bit overwhelming for people when they first look at it but pretty simple so we've got our blue line is our profit and loss at expiration the purple line is what we call a t plus zero line how does the trade look as of today and as we get closer to exploration this purple line will slowly come up towards the Blue Line okay so $70 our Max profit Break Even price 2930 which is the stripe Price Less the premium we don't really there's not a lot more we can talk about with the profit and loss graph right it is what it is but the one thing I do go through with each trade is I have a little cash secured put calculator in EXL some of you might have a copy if you don't I'll send it out when I send out the replay all we need to fill in is these cells in green okay so we're going to put in our expiration date stock price our strike price and the option premium key things I'm looking at here are these two numbers so we've got a nearly 5% decrease to our break even price of 29 30 and we've got an annualized return or potential annualized return of 79% which I think you'll agree is pretty high now that's because it's a high beta High volatility stock 51% volatility here on this particular option all right let's compare the slightly longer term one so that's October 18th so here we're getting a larger decrease to our break even because our strike price is a bit lower and we're getting a lower annualized return because it's taking us longer even though the premium's higher it's taking us a lot longer five times as long to get that premium so our annualized return is lower still pretty good uh yes this is my calculator I will give you a copy all right let's look at the last example this one okay so now see how this is working the further out in time we go we're getting a higher decrease to our break even but a lower annualized return now I'm not saying this one's the best because the returns higher and I'm not saying this one's the best because the decrease to break even is the lowest or the the biggest it's all about finding a style that works for you and once you get to know your underlings you'll start to know you know is this a good annualized return for this particular stock the other thing to consider if you're going to do this version with only 11 days to expiry it's going to take more active management okay because you're going to be in the trade for 11 days you might take profits halfway through you might get a sign then You' got to move to phase two you're going to be a lot more active so you're going to have to keep an eye on things a lot more that might be hard if you're pressed for time you're working full-time got kids all all the usual stuff and it might be harder to manage yes the return is the highest but it takes more work you know this is a good little sort of in the- Middle option not as active and this one is very very hands-off we're not really having to do much at all so it's about finding a style that works for you and a return potential that you're happy with all right let's compare now pltr let's make a copy of this and now we're going to compare fisa a stock that's trading around about the same price but obviously a much lower volatility so 33 Delta we've got October we haven't got FIB but we'll go January see how um pltr is trading with 48% volatility on the actual stock and then this one's trading at 51% volatility we're going to see a big difference here in fisa the Stock's only trading at 21% volatility and this one's at about 28% 21% volatility as well so now um trade dates the same price is 28 91 much lower annualized return okay again not saying one's better than the other this one's just going to be a bit l stressful maybe right um then this one so we've got now only a 133% annualized return now we're getting 9% Mar eror and only a 10% annualized return okay so much lower returns in fisa but that's because the volatility is lower the beta is a lot lower okay both of those could be good underlyings to to do this on um just depends what you're looking for all right any questions so far now another thing thing you can do and this is where we kind of get into volatility term structure and actually I might just try and set this up on the other screen uh good question here from Rob when we're looking at Delta should we look at Theta as well um I don't really look at the Theta but I do take that into consideration when I'm looking at these annualized return numbers but I don't look at the actual value of theta the main thing I would look at is the Delta and the actual strike the decrease to break even and the annualized return that's pretty much it no problem okay so this is another little cool thing that we can do uh with bar chart premium we get oh actually I think it's extra barart Excel you can actually look at the term structure of an individual stock so what we're looking at here is the implied volatility across different expiration dates okay so this week's expiration next week so on and so forth out to 2026 now why would there be such high volatility here can anyone tell me really high volatility in the shortterm options and lower volatility in the longer term options let's compare that with a different stock yeah earnings exactly yep so there's huge volatility around the earnings announcement uh in a couple of days time let's compare to Apple Apple's already reported earnings so there's a bit of noise here but generally there's not a whole lot of difference here between short-term and longterm but it is generally lower at the front and higher the further out we go that's sort of what you'd see normally for a stock and then just before earnings you're going to see this type of shape so we can actually use that to our advantage if we like Nvidia it's actually a great time obviously there's risk because everything's a trade-off with options right High return equals high risk but let's say we like Nvidia earnings are on the 28th these expire after earnings huge implied volatility there's our 35 Delta will kind of keep it consistent with the other examples that we've been looking at now this isn't for everyone because it is riskier to do this around earnings but risk and return are always interrelated at 121 445 premium pretty decent decrease to our break even and a massive annualized return potential massive because the stocks trading with implied volatility of 71% but this option because of the earnings is trading at 132% volatility so volatility is massively overpriced and it can be a good time to do a cash secured put on Nvidia if you like the stock and if you're happy to buy it at 121 now the risk is of course we could the market might not like what they hear and the stock could drop 20% you know that's possible risk and return always interrelated High return potential high risk but certainly that's a pretty pretty unbelievable return right even going out to the September expiration our returns are still going to be pretty high there's our 35 Delta still pretty high 85% return our strike price is more or less the same but we've got an extra 21 days to wait so if I'm happy to buy Nvidia at around 120 I'm way better off doing this one compared to this one right and look at the difference in Vol and that's that contango that we're talking about oh sorry bation it is if you've heard that term that was the the term structure we were looking at really high volatility in the short-term puts compared to the longer term puts so if like envid at around 120 you're way better off doing this one than this one any thoughts comments or questions on that okay so if we were to do say this one if Nvidia drops below 121 we get assigned we buy shares at 121 depending on where the Stock's trading we might sell another put down at 110 and we might sell a call up at 125 then if a video keeps going down below 110 we buy another 100 shares now we're selling calls what would our net price be about 11750 we're making sure we sell our calls up at say 120 or above the other thing you may consider doing is having a bit of Crash protection rather than going with a naked cash secured put you might want to just buy a really cheap out of the money put just in case now unfortunately because of earnings everything's still pretty expensive but you could potentially buy that now a lot of times buying this is going to be a waste of time it's not going to help you but just on the off chance and video drops your losses are capped at 105 but most of the time that's not going to be worth it um question here how to apply this with a stock that continues to fall over time examples WBA and E yeah you want to try and avoid situations like that again using that 200 day moving average as a guide is a good idea so for example Walgreens um you want us you want to try and avoid dying companies dying Industries um you know with look at Walgreens we're going to have to even go back further um you know it's been in such a bad downtrend look at that it's being distributed so badly people are selling people aren't buying the dip there's distribution occurring um let's see if we can see I'm going to have to actually keep this at Daily which is going to make it a bit messy because I want to try and see where it crossed below the 200 day moving average so you see here even when it was up at about 40 once it got below that 200 day moving average in the 200 day started to Trend downwards you know you just want to avoid that scenario Al together uh Robert says I seem to like 35 Delta any reason um no it's just kind of a good balance between generating decent premium and also having a a reasonably decent Break Even price a decrease to your break even um so yeah definitely want to try and avoid situations like this and that's where um ETFs can be a really good option returns are going to be lower but you're going to avoid situations like this all right so I've got a template as well for tracking trades which I'll go through and I'll give you all a copy of this after uh the webinar so this is one that I've been doing for a while now so Ewa is a country ETF it's the Australian uh ETF it's been amazing for the wheel to be honest pays a great dividend you know four and a half 5% yield pretty low volatility and it kind of just bounces around between the high tensens low 20s up to the mid 20s so it's great it's bouncing around here through this period you know you're selling puts you're getting assigned you wait for it to bounce you sell calls you're collecting dividends you know you keep adding as it drops it's an ETF so it's probably not going to go to zero so started in Feb 2023 actually started um with the cash SK put then I had some Capital to allocate end up just buying 1,200 shares and basically you do um is you anytime anything's closed you zero it out and then this is just the the current value to close everything I've got you know selling puts selling calls collecting dividends and basically got these positions open, 1400 shares oh the other thing I'll do sometimes is sell less calls than I own of the stock so that will allow me a little bit more upside appreciation so you can see here I've got 1,400 shares but I'm only selling 12 calls uh then just put in the value to close of the open option positions this will fill in automatically because it's the stock be of uh of excel you can actually just automatically bring in the the stock price so you can see here started uh starting price was 2402 back in Feb 2023 up about 7 and a half Grand or about 19% even though the Stock's only gone up 7.7 um and then I've got a little calculator here as well I'll kind of go through this examples maybe a bit complex but basically um you take let's say we just look at these first few examples go back to the the early um part of the trade so I've bought those shares bought shares there bought shares there so that's my what I would call my gross cost basis right uh equals that divided by, 1400 so that's my gross cost per share but then I want to take that number and I want to subtract out any premium and any dividends that I've received so this is actually my net cost after option premiums and dividends does that make sense do you understand the difference and this is helpful when I'm deciding where to sell my calls generally I'm going to want to sell them at above 23 but if I'm really wanting to get out of the position I know that I can sell them at around 22 22 A2 and still come away with a slight profit so that's a little calculation I'll do which is kind of hidden a little bit here but um this is this sort of thing here um another example ewu um this one uh my shares got called away a while ago so I'm now just in the the selling put phase um so Stock's up at 37 so that's probably going to it's out to January so might expire worthless might not but again stocks up about 14% I'm up 23% uh ewz's another one I've got going on the stocks down 12% and I'm just around my break even price so hopefully pretty straightforward on how to use that I've got a couple of um Australian ones that I've just started as well so I got those there and last example this has been a tough one but the stock's down 41% I initially bought shares at 45 bought some more at 28 bought some more at 27 bought some more at 24 a half lots of option premium and dividends right and only down 1% on the trade compared to down 42 % on the stock so I'll give you a copy of that then you can just start um your new one here these are kind of um a data tab here these are kind of um what's the word you have to select one of these you can't type your own in but either way you can update those on the data tab if you want but yeah basically selling to open a cach secured put that's going to be your first step your symbol expiration date right price hopefully pretty straightforward all right any questions that's pretty much all I wanted to cover today um so I'll get you the copy of the slides and the wheel template here um and I'll send the replay out toone so you can watch that again if you feel the need to um but I hope you enjoyed it if you've got any followup questions you think of after feel free to just shoot me an email info option trading iq.com um question here how do you decide your position size for your portfolio for each tracker also how many open positions do you usually have on different tickets at the same time yeah each to their own in terms of position size you might want to keep each position to to five % something like that depends on the stock if it's a stock or an ETF you know you could do you could do this on spy and that could maybe be a really larger part of your portfolio whereas if you're doing individual stocks like pltr you'd probably want it to be a little bit smaller um and how many at the one time probably want to have less than five to 10 but again depends on how much Capital you've got too if you've got a small account of only 50,000 it's going to be quite hard to do the wheel to be honest um because it does require quite a bit of capital think about Nvidia the example that we looked at if you get assigned on that first lot of 100 shares that's 12 Grand on another lot at say 11 110 that's another 11 Grand you're looking at 23 Grand to buy 200 shares so then you got to think about how big is that in terms of your total account size you know if you've got a $100,000 account that's 23% of your account tied up in that one stock so a lot of it will depend on how much Capital you have as well oh one other thing one other thing what we can do as well um if it's a stock that doesn't pay a dividend so I had one on Uber recently um and let's say the stocks dropped I know Uber's kind of rallied recently but you know let's say we sold this one and Uber has dropped below our strike price and it's looking like we might get a sign maybe we're getting close to expiration sometimes what I'll do is I'll actually roll so rather than waiting and taking assignment at 74 I might roll it out to October and I'll delay assignment and maybe wait for the stock to recover and you can see here I could roll that out a month and I've lowered my strike price by a dollar and a half and I've received a credit of about $45 so I buy that one back for $295 I sell that one for 340 net credit of about $40 and I've moved my strike lower so that's a nice little trick you can do as well if you're not quite ready to take assignment yet uh yeah Dave how about adjustments yeah that's kind of one adjustment um probably not too many others that I would use uh hey Craig I've got to do a couple of courses um the next one is options income Mastery starting end of September so that's a one- month course uh we'll do four live webinars we'll look at um about 10 case studies on different strategies so we'll look at we'll look at the wheel we'll look at uh credit spreads Condors calendars butterflies um so keep an eye out for that one uh and then I also run a 12-month program called the accelerator uh that just closed for enrollment earlier in the month that'll be open again in November um so if you're on my email list um I'll email you when those are open all right thanks everyone appreciate the kind words um happy to stick around for another couple of minutes if there's
