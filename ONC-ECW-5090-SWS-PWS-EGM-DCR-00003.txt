1.Introduction
1.1Purpose
The purpose of this report is to describe the Design Criteria for the GO Rail Expansion - On-Corridor (OnCorr) line stations requiring renovations as part of the Metrolinx On-Corridor expansion works. This document does not include discussion for Spadina and Union Stations as they have their own Basis of Design (BoD). This report includes the GO line stations which are understood to be in the approved scope of work as displayed in the ONxpress Train Service Plan (TSP) issued in December of 2022. They have been summarized in the “Line Stations Scope Memo, v.01 DRAFT”, which was sent to the ONxpress Construction Joint Venture (CJV) via email on Feb. 16, 2023. The scope boundaries defined in the TSP are considered to override the specific station requirements stated in Project Agreement (PA) Technical Segment Schedule C-6 Sub-sections C.2 through C.12 and C.15 through C.20.
Subsequent station details will be added according to future bundle assignments and updates to the TSP as the GO Rail Expansion - On-Corridor Program (OnCorr) progresses. As a result, it is expected that this document will be updated with revisions as the scope boundaries and work bundle assignments are solidified.
The report summarizes the scope of work applicable to the BoD criteria that will be considered as part of the ONxpress Civil Infrastructure and Buildings Design Work.
1.2GO Rail Expansion – On-Corridor
GO Transit is a regional transit system serving the Golden Horseshoe region of Ontario with a hub at Union Station in Toronto. It operates on infrastructure that is either owned by Metrolinx (MX territory), or by third parties such as Canadian National (CN) Railway or Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), or non-MX territory.
GO Rail Expansion is a program which will provide more travel options for residents and commuters. Upon delivery, the GO Rail Expansion program will provide faster, more frequent, two-way, all-day service on core segments of the GO rail network.
The On-Corridor Works are part of the Province's GO Rail Expansion. For the GO Expansion, the fleet is expected to switch to electric locomotives. There are no further indications of specific vehicle requirements.
1.3Abbreviations
The abbreviations in Table 1 are commonly used in the Project Agreement, Metrolinx ONxpress, Regulators and other stakeholders’ documentation. Some of the terms used are acronyms developed by ONxpress to organize the work of the GO Rail Expansion - On-Corridor Program (OnCorr).

2.3Health and Safety
The safety of personnel is of paramount importance to all stakeholders, and this will be reflected in the civil design. EJV is committed to providing and maintaining a healthy and safe work environment for all personnel by complying with our Health and Safety Management Plan as well as following the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA), the Ontario Regulations for Construction Projects (O.Regs) and any additional safety requirements from the PA. OHSA, as well as the Health and Safety Management Plan, specify the design safety philosophy which emphasizes compliance with legislation, standards, and safety in design principles. The design shall incorporate all requirements of the latest edition of the Canada Occupational Health and Safety Regulations (SOR/86-304), amended on December 7, 2012.
The objective of the Health and Safety Management Plan is to conduct all ONxpress related work activities with zero workplace injuries, incidents or illnesses. The Systems Assurance Management Plan covers all the requirements assignment, requirements demonstration, integration, safety, security, and RAM activities related to all systems, subsystems, components, civil and infrastructure work being delivered for OnCorr.
Safe solutions are part of our core value, thus will be embedded in all design aspects related to the Infrastructure Civil Works. The design process will ensure compliance to applicable codes, regulations, standards, as well as project specific safety requirements.
3.Construction Work Packages Scope Description
There are 11 line stations in the GO network of which the GO Rail Expansion - On-Corridor Program (OnCorr) requires initial civil and building renovation works. The design of the stations is heavily driven by the requirements provided by Deutsche Bahn (DB), the Operations and Maintenance (O&M) partner, and Alstom, the Electrical and Mechanical (E&M) partner within ONxpress. Their design requirements for the overall GO Rail Expansion - On-Corridor Program (OnCorr) are principally considered above C6 requirements. The solutions devised make best use of Enabling Works, mentioned by Project Sponsors (MX and IO), with adjustments having been made to the initial plan by DB.
All new facilities designed by ONxpress will adhere to applicable MX Design Standards. The new facilities will require mechanical, electrical and communication services in compliance with all other codes and regulations in addition to MX Design Standards. All disturbed areas at each line station will be seeded and returned to their original state as they were pre-construction.
There are three (3) main sources in determining the scope of works to be performed or executed for each station. Below the main sources have been listed, in the order of precedence:
1.A development scope provided by DB through its 2055 plan.
2.Project Sponsor motioned PA Schedule C6 requirements “Fixed Assets - Initial Works Output Specifications”.
3.Project Sponsor motioned Enabling Works descriptions provided by PA Schedule C5.
Table 5 and Table 6 have the list of line stations confirmed to be in scope as well as one station, Burlington GO Station which is unconfirmed, but that which may require design work relevant to OnCorr.

1.Danforth GO Station, located in the Kingston Subdivision.
2.Stouffville GO Station, located in the Uxbridge Subdivision.
3.Durham College Oshawa GO Station, located in the Kingston Subdivision.
The 11 line stations which are included in the scope of work are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Existing Stations Renovations Plan
3.1Lakeshore West – Oakville
The GO line stations that are in the Oakville Subdivision are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Lakeshore West Corridor & Oakville Subdivision Diagram
The Oakville Subdivision includes the following line station:
Port GO Credit Station; Oakville Subdivision - (20+540 to 20+960).
3.1.1Port Credit GO Station TBC
Port Credit GO Station is a train and bus station in Mississauga. It is owned by MX, operated by GO transit and located at 30 Queen Street East. Port Credit has one (1) side platform and one (1) island platform and with three (3) tracks running through. It includes a mini-platform and a canopy for a portion of the platform length. Additionally, it includes pedestrian shelters that are under the canopy and part of the same structure.
The station building is at the end of Helene Street North, and west of Queen Street East. It has vertical circulation (elevators and stairs) leading to the south platform from below. There are bus stops located south of the station building with connections to MiWay, formerly Mississauga Transit. There is a Bike Shelter also located on the property.
C6 does not indicate scope for this location, however, scope is shown in the December 2022 TSP. See Figure 3, where the “red” portion indicates required platform widening work.

Figure 3: Port Credit Station Diagram as per baseline 3.2. This will be updated as per new TSP
3.2Kitchener – Weston
The GO line stations that are in the Weston Subdivision are shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4: Kitchener Corridor & Weston Subdivision Diagram
The Weston Subdivision includes the following line station:
Etobicoke North GO Station; Weston Subdivision - (17+785 to TBD); Kitchener.
3.2.1Etobicoke North GO Station
Etobicoke North GO Station is a commuter GO train and bus station in the Weston Subdivision. It is owned by MX and operated by GO transit. It is located at 1949 Kipling Avenue just north of Belfield Road, close to the junction of Highways 401 and 409. See Figure 5 where “yellow” indicates required demolition.

Figure 5: Etobicoke North Station Diagram as per baseline 3.2. This will be updated as per new TSP
Etobicoke North has three (3) mainline tracks and one (1) side platform serving only the northernmost track. A fourth track passes along the north side of the station, but it is only used for local freight trains. The platform is connected by staircases and ramps from Kipling Avenue, which crosses below the tracks.
PA Schedule C6 section C.10 requires the full demolition and decommissioning of the station. This is in line with C5 project #47 for Woodbine Station (which is expected to serve in lieu of Etobicoke North Station). Included in the OnCorr scope is the full demolition of the current Etobicoke North Station which would free up space for the railway to be widened from three (3) mainline tracks to four (4).
3.3Barrie – Newmarket
The line stations in the Newmarket Subdivision are shown in Figure 6, which displays existing stations only, and not Caledonia GO Station which will be constructed by other contractors in between Downsview Park Station and Union Station:

Figure 6: Barrie Corridor & Newmarket Subdivision Diagram
The Newmarket Subdivision is composed of the following line stations:
East Gwillimbury GO Station; Newmarket Subdivision South - (57+272 to 56+950.62).
York University GO Station; Newmarket Subdivision South - (20+084.4 to 20+412.4).
Caledonia GO Station: Newmarket Subdivision South - (10+489.89 to 10+804.89).
3.3.1East Gwillimbury GO Station
East Gwillimbury GO Station is a commuter train and bus station at 845 Green Lane East which is situated south of Green Lane and to the west of the Nokiidaa Bike Trail. It has a Bus Loop on the north side where GO bus service supplements trains when there are no trains scheduled. The Bus Loop has surface connections to York Region Transit (YRT) buses. The station building has a brick façade and is situated between the parking lot and tracks. It is handicap accessible and has a Bike Shelter located on the property.
East Gwillimbury has a concrete side platform with three (3) shelters and no canopy currently. A concrete walkway connects the station to the Bus Loop, Green Lane to the north and the Nokiidaa Bike Trail. See Figure 7 where “yellow” indicates the required demolition work and “red” indicates construction.

Figure 7: East Gwillimbury Station Diagram as per baseline 3.2. This will be updated as per new TSP
The scope for OnCorr includes the demolition of the existing platform on the west side of the tracks, as well as two (2) new side platforms, two (2) new pedestrian bridges, a new pedestrian at-grade crossing, and a new ancillary building, street furniture and fixtures required as per the OBC. The work described above is in line with C6, section C.15. The C5, project #48 included minor renovation work and a secure bike room was constructed at this location; however, it does not appear to have had any major impact on current scope of OnCorr design work.
3.3.2York University GO Station
York University GO Station was a former train station in the Newmarket Subdivision owned by MX and located at 595-A Canarctic Drive in Toronto. The station was closed on July 19, 2021, and was later demolished in April of 2022, with only a concrete ledge and signage remaining. Refer to Figure 8 where “yellow” indicates the required demolition scope.

Figure 8: York University Station Diagram as per baseline 3.2. This will be updated as per new TSP
York University Station consisted of a single end platform on the west of two (2) tracks with passenger shelters and a ticket vending machine. To expand the Barrie Line for all-day, two-way service, it is necessary to demolish the station to construct a third track. The scope for OnCorr includes the demolition of the remaining platform structure and necessary grading.
3.3.3Caledonia GO Station
Caledonia GO Station is a new station that will be directly integrated with the Eglinton Crosstown LRT (ECLRT) and Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) buses in the future. It is located at 2400 Eglinton Avenue West in Toronto. One (1) GO train platform will be constructed by other parties. The elevation of the platform is beneath Eglinton Avenue West and is connected to the adjacent Caledonia ECLRT station via an underground pedestrian tunnel. The planned configuration can be seen in Figure 9.

Figure 9: Caledonia Station Diagram (2032 Plan) as per baseline 3.2. 
This will be updated as per new TSP
Once open, a pedestrian bridge will connect the GO station to the ECLRT station's main entrance. The GO station will have a second entrance at its north end where both the York Beltline Trail and Bowie Avenue end. Additional details regarding current work taking place are available in the description of project #29 of PA Schedule C5. In the future, through the GO Rail Expansion - On-Corridor Program (OnCorr), a second track will be installed for the GO line to enable all-day, two-way GO train service.
The scope at Caledonia Station from the TSP is broadly in line with the requirements provided in section C.12 of PA Schedule C6. It includes one (1) new side platform, one (1) new pedestrian tunnel, an extension to the pedestrian bridge, a new noise wall, new ancillary building, a walkway connection to the Belt Line Trail, street furniture and required fixtures as per the OBC. Coordination will take place with the construction contractor for C5 project #29, as the new tunnel in the OnCorr scope would need to be provided with an entrance structure on the platform provided by the C5 project. Also, the design of a pedestrian bridge parallel to Eglinton is not very conducive for an extension to the east side platform to be designed for OnCorr.
3.4Stouffville – Uxbridge
The GO line stations that are in the Uxbridge Subdivision are shown in Figure 10.

Figure 10: Stouffville Corridor & Uxbridge Subdivision Diagram
The Uxbridge Subdivision is composed of the following stations:
Stouffville Station; Uxbridge Subdivision - (46+063.98 to 46+425.19).
Kennedy Station; Uxbridge Subdivision - (15+678.55 to 15+878.55).
Buildings in this section cover the MX-owned, GO Transit Uxbridge corridor, operating between the Kingston rail subdivision and Old Elm GO Station.
3.4.1Stouffville GO Station TBC
Stouffville GO Station is a train and bus station in the Uxbridge Subdivision, owned by MX and operated by GO transit. It is at 6176 Main Street West, north of Main Street and to east of Edward Street in Stouffville. Stouffville GO is a designated historic station with its main building located to the south and east of the platform. The station has a mini-platform but no canopy above its side platform. There is also a recently constructed Bike Shelter to the north of the station building. Stouffville Station has one (1) side platform on the east side which is topped with asphalt. One (1) set of tracks runs though the station area. Figure 11 displays the 40 m platform extension to the north.

Figure 11: Stouffville 40m Platform Extension Diagram to the North as per baseline 3.2
There are four (4) shelters located on the platform area. The York-Durham Heritage Railway runs historical trains between the station and Uxbridge on summer weekends. As a part of C5 project #48, new yellow tactile safety tiles will be installed at the edge of the platform, as well as new digital signs to display trip information on the platform. The scope of OnCorr involves a 40m platform extension to the north including any required grading and drainage adjustments.
3.4.2Kennedy GO Station
Kennedy GO Station is a train station in Toronto located at 2467 Eglinton Avenue East. It is in the Uxbridge Subdivision and is connected to the adjacent Kennedy TTC subway station which has bus and subway connections to Line 2 Bloor–Danforth and Line 3 Scarborough. In the future, it will also connect with the Line 5 Eglinton Crosstown LRT. See Figure 12.

Figure 12: Kennedy Station Diagram (2032 Plan) as per baseline 3.2. 
This will be updated as per new TSP
Kennedy Station has one (1) track running through the station area with the east side platform currently being in service. There is no permanent station building or staffed ticket booth at this location. Four (4) shelters are situated along the length of the platform. C5 project #19 specifies the construction of the west platform which is also required to be extended towards the north as per C6 section C.17. The ONxpress TSP from December of 2022 is in alignment with this. The C5 west platform construction is precast concrete, and it will have a glycol snow melting system. Kennedy Station will also require a new ancillary building to house the mechanical equipment for the new glycol snow melting system.
3.5Lakeshore East – Kingston
The GO line stations that are in the Kingston Subdivision are shown in Figure 13.

Figure 13: Lakeshore East Corridor & Kingston Subdivision Diagram
The Kingston Subdivision is composed of the following stations:
Danforth GO Station; Kingston Subdivision - (8+337.24 to 8+680.85).
Durham College Oshawa GO Station; Kingston Subdivision - (50+344.57 to TBD).
Scarborough GO Station; Kingston Subdivision - (12+500 to 14+700).
Architectural and buildings in this section cover the MX-owned, GO Transit Lakeshore East rail subdivision, operating between Union Station and Durham College Oshawa GO Station.
3.5.1Danforth GO Station
Danforth GO Station is a train station owned by MX in Toronto at 213 Main Street. The station’s main building is north of the tracks. It has two (2) storeys and is connected to an underground pedestrian tunnel. The tunnel services a side platform on the north side of the tracks and an island platform situated between the middle and southern tracks. The north side platform has a mini-platform and passenger shelters, but it does not have a canopy. The island platform is connected to the pedestrian tunnel by stairs and an elevator.
South of the tracks, there is a vertical circulation structure and a service building which contains equipment for mechanical and electrical systems. A concrete walkway connects the station to Ted Reeve Drive to the east and to Little York Road to the west. A Bike Shelter is located on the property to the south of the station.
The scope for OnCorr includes the extension of the pedestrian tunnel to reach a new set of vertical circulation (stairs and elevators) that will be located south of the tracks, constructing a new south platform, and a new non-conditioned pedestrian bridge. The pedestrian bridge is a part of a later stage than the rest of the design work, however construction may need to proceed with all work at once.
A new ancillary building will be required to provide services to the new and expanded facilities. The new facilities will require mechanical, electrical and communication services in compliance with MX standards. Access to the south platform should be through specific access points for control of passengers.
Demolition is required of the existing mechanical boiler room structure to enable the construction of a fourth track. Refer to Figure 14 which shows the 2032 Plan diagram including the future pedestrian bridge, and Figure 15 and Figure 16, also display the existing 3D as-built model for Danforth Station.

3.5.2Durham College Oshawa GO Station
Durham College Oshawa GO Station is a commuter train and regional bus service station in Oshawa. It is located at 915 Bloor Street West, in the Kingston Subdivision, owned by MX and operated by GO transit. It has a Bus Loop to the west of the station building and a parking lot stretching north to Bloor Street which was constructed as result of C5 projects #17 and #48. Under C5 project #67, the northern GO track would be continued to serve the Bowmanville Extension Project. One (1) island platform is connected to the station building from the east end. It can accommodate up to 12-car trains on each side.
See Figure 17 from the TSP 2032 Plan, where “red” indicates the modification needed to the platform in support of operational adjustment. The “purple” indicates work by others and shows that MX is providing a connection to the currently existing pedestrian bridge structure.

Figure 17: Oshawa Station Diagram as per Baseline 3.2. This will be updated as per new TSP
Currently identified OnCorr scope involves designing a new side platform to the north of the tracks for a new terminal line into the station, a new ancillary building, a retaining wall north of the new platform, and an at-grade signalized pedestrian crossing at the GO Bus Loop. The Bus Loop may need to be relocated slightly to the north impacting some of the parking spots. For egress purposes in the case of an emergency, the west end of the platform will be connected via a new path to a nearby service road currently being used by MX maintenance vehicles. This would ensure emergency vehicle access to the point where pedestrian connection from the platform meets this service road.
3.5.3Scarborough GO Station
Scarborough GO Station is located to the south of St. Clair Avenue, west of Midland Avenue, and at the end of Reeve Avenue. It is owned by MX and operates in the Kingston Subdivision. A station building is located between the parking lot to the southeast, and the tracks to the northwest.
Scarborough Station has four (4) tracks running through the station area, including one (1) bypass track. It currently has one (1) side platform and one (1) island platform. It has a mini-platform and a canopy above it for a portion of the platform length. Minor work is being performed as part of C5 project #48 including constructing a secure bike room, installing platform edge tiles and digital signage, but it does not have impact on the currently established scope for OnCorr. The scope as provided by C6 section C.2 is not being completely followed as the TSP has provided alternative scope. The scope of OnCorr includes the full demolition of the south platform. See Figure 18, where “yellow” indicates the demolition scope.

4.Architectural Design Criteria
This section provides a summary of design criteria, considerations and assumptions used in the design of buildings and facilities, vertical circulation, grade separated crossings to any platforms, and service hubs in relation to Line Station works. This includes construction of new platforms and related service buildings to adjusting the current construction of the platform to align with the track design and operation requirement of ONxpress. It also includes design criteria based on code, accessibility, passenger modelling, and signage/wayfinding considerations. For the detailed design of grade separations, refer to the BoD entitled, “Grade Separations Design Criteria” document (ONC-ECW-5090-SWS-PWS-EGM-DCR-00014).
The architectural design solution provided is dependent on the extent of such modifications needed at these stations as well as the construction constraint in carrying out the construction. The design as such remains performance compliant with requirements stipulated in Part C of C6 of the PA. This design brief also ensure that design complies with the requirements defined in OBC, NBC, AODA, CAN/CSA B651, CSA 460:19, NFPA 130, MX DRM, MX Design Standards documents, and those of authorities having jurisdiction such as City of Toronto if applicable. The criteria include the basic framework regarding design material properties, durability considerations, accessibility requirements, universal design, architectural design standards, and sustainability criteria.
This section only details the design in relation to permanent structures.
4.1Architectural Vision
Refer to Architectural Design Vision – Program-Wide Architectural Report: 
ONC-ECW-5090-SWS-ART-DES-RPT-00002
4.2Architectural Scope Delineation
The architectural design has following inputs from other disciplines:
1.Track: Overall platform geometry and location. They will provide the necessary clearances for dynamic clearances.
2.Structural: Structural make up of platform construction, structural systems for canopy, roofs, walls, retaining walls, foundations, and miscellaneous supports for elements such as roof anchors, screens, signage, etc. OCS foundations and structural design integration into canopy. Below grade tunnels will also require structural input.
3.Civil: Overall design and layout for parking, PUDO, Bus Loops, site drainage, platform drainage, emergency access routes, fire routes, and maintenance access. Fencing between tracks.
4.Landscape: Benches and receptacles (not on platform), site fencing, planters, vegetation, pedestrian pathways, overall site plan.
5.Mechanical: confirmation on roof drainage type based on storm water reports, platform drain locations, locations of pits and access, rainwater leader and drainage locations, platform snow melting, elevator conditioning, overall ventilation of station buildings, fire and life safety systems. Sizing of ancillary building based on mechanical equipment.
6.Electrical/Comms.: location and sizes of duct banks with locations for access, overall platform and station lighting, emergency lighting, power for devices and equipment. Sizing of ancillary building based on electrical and comms equipment. Comms housing for exterior TV/Screens, site security, and CCTV locations.
7.OCS: Location and type of OCS that affect platform canopy and structures.

4.3Program Requirements
The TMO document: ONC-ECW-3710-DAS-ART-DES-TMO-00001.docx can be referenced for information regarding Architectural Program Requirements.
4.4Architectural Design Criteria
4.4.1Platform Design
The platforms will be precast construction. The intention of precast design is to construct and prefabricate elements offsite to minimize site disruption, enhance buildability, decrease construction time, and increase workflow efficiencies. Foundations pads (unless specifically otherwise noted on a station), foundation walls and platform slabs consist of precast elements. The modularity and duplicity of such precast elements will be on a per station design basis defined in the platform setting out plans produced as part of the technical documentation process. There are exceptions in cases where platform modifications and extensions are required. If the modifications/extensions affect less than twenty percent (20%) of the platform and/or where the benefits of continuing existing method of construction outweigh the cost and methodological benefits of precast, the platform will not be of precast construction.
The total length of the platform will be 315 m, unless specified in the technical drawings. The platform will be divided in 7 m uniform grids of 3500 mm wide by 4900 mm panels for side platforms, and 2 x 3500 mm by 3600 mm wide precast concrete panels for island platforms separated by a trench drain in the middle (unless specified by track geometry). Electrical, mechanical, security, and communication requirements for snow melting, connections, maintenance access, openings, and sleeves will be accommodated and designed as part of the precast elements. Similarly, space allocations for the 610 mm wide architectural tactile walking surface indicators (TWSI) will be accommodated by pre-imbedding the tiles. There will be no wayfinding TWSI throughout any of the Line Stations.
MX GO DRM will dictate the design of minimum platform clearances and other platform requirements such as canopy and furnishings. The general rail platform design criteria can be found in Table 7.

4.4.2Canopy Design
Canopies on rail platforms will be integrated into all new platforms and shall be designed so that its components are modular. As per DRM, Section 5.2.2 requirements, the canopy will be continuous and extend to provide coverage for at least 85% of the platform length with a minimum clearance of 3350 mm to the underside of the canopy, and 2440 mm to the underside of digital screens and signage. The canopy will be utilized as an electrical and communications raceway, it will house lighting and communications equipment such as speakers, digital screens/signage, and security equipment. Service access will be provided at modular intervals and concealed along the spine of the canopy. New canopies will integrate OCS into its structure and provide an anchoring base plate for the catenary system to be connected in another phase. The feasibility of canopy additions at line stations with existing platform modifications will be evaluated on a case per case basis. Generally, modifications to platforms of more than 40% will trigger an extension to the existing canopy design to a length of 85% coverage of the modified platform. If the platform does not have an existing canopy, a new canopy will not be added. Similarly, if the modification to the platform is less than 40%, a canopy will not be added.
The design and materiality of the canopy will be confirmed at DDS.
4.4.3Ancillary Building
Ancillary buildings are service buildings that are centrally located adjacent to the platform serviced. There are three (3) modules defined during the RFP stage which form the BoD. Modules are chosen based on specific needs of the station renovation and information provided by MX as per as-built documentation (to be site verified during the validation phase). The ancillary building support critical back of house infrastructure necessary for the operations of the station building, this includes mechanical, electrical, and communication rooms, they may have other modules added such as bike storage rooms.
For these buildings, the roof consists of a single ply white PVC membrane, min. SRI: 82, min. 3yr aged SRI:64, with tapered polyisocyanurate rigid insulation as required to form a min. 1.5% finished slope to drain. The system rests on 13 mm high density polyiso covered board, 13 mm glass fiber reinforced gypsum sheathing on steel deck supported on steel joists.
Walls are composed of a 190 mm CMU back up wall with 127 mm semi-rigid mineral fiber insulation and prefinished aluminum composite wall panels supported by galvanized thermally broken cladding support system. Walls site on sealed concrete floor and structural foundation. The design requirements for specific ancillary building room spaces are shown in Table 8.
Table 8: Design Requirements for Ancillary Building Spaces
Ancillary Space

4.4.4Enclosures
The general design principles of architectural elements such as station and ancillary buildings, hubs, vertical circulation, and shelters will follow the design set out by the GO Station Architecture Design Standard - DS-04, Universal Design Standard – DS-02, Sustainable Design Standard – DS-05, GO DRM, and GO MX standard details and specifications.
The clearance from the edge of the platform-to-platform structures must meet a minimum of 2.44 m inclusive of the TWSI. The minimum widths of side and central platforms place a restriction for the total width of the enclosures to a width of roughly 1.8 m, thus having an impact on the number of stairs required for tunnels and bridges from a passenger modelling and code perspective. All platform structures must be designed for passive protection with height requirements prescribed by DB and design as specified by MX Level Boarding – Part 1, Passive Protection.
For CPTED concerns, enclosures must be fully glazed and integrated under the platform canopy, be min.10 mm thick tempered structural glazing, butt jointed, fastened at the bottom by a continuous stainless-steel U-channel embedded into the 0.4 m high concrete curb, with the top fastened with a stainless-steel slip-connection to the structural steel beams above. The glazing shall have a distraction decal on surface 2 and ceramic frit on surface 1, the exterior face of glass, which has proven the most effective for bird deterrence. The design will follow the CSA 460:19 Bird Friendly Building Design Guidelines for patterning and treatment.

Both stair and elevators will be designed for passive protection as set out in Section 4.4.9 of this report.
4.4.8Tunnels & Tunnel Extensions
The tunnel is defined as the precast or cast-in-place RC portion of the underground structure perpendicular to the tracks. New tunnels and tunnel extensions will be provided in stations as per C6 - Part C of the PA. The new tunnel(s) will be designed in accordance with MX Design Standard DS-04, and specifically Section 2.4.6. General considerations include CPTED, building code, and passenger modelling.
New tunnels shall have a minimum clear width of 3660 mm unless a deviation is required, and this process will be dictated by passenger modelling requirements. The design will include methods of mounting raceways to the metal panel ceiling, where mechanical, electrical, and communications elements are concealed or arranged in a clean and organized manner. The minimum clearance required is 2700 mm, with 2400 mm min. to the underside of signage. Drainage gutters will align with the interior walls of the tunnel on either side, where a minimum of 0.3% slope to gutter is required for drainage.
The vertical circulation area is defined as the perpendicular portion that connects the tunnel structure to the platforms, including stairs and elevators. The design will provide a minimum two (2) elevators and two (2) staircases to the platform areas. The widths of the vertical circulation elements are designed in accordance with the code requirements for exiting under the Ontario Building Code and/or NFPA 130. Where a tunnel meets areas of vertical circulation, walls will bevelled to allow a 45-degree angle path of travel to the tunnel, which improves safety and passenger flow.
Tunnel extensions will follow existing design and form, which will connect to new vertical circulation areas. Where the new and existing tunnel sections intersect, tunnels shall have a uniform and integrated appearance.

The ancillary buildings are for system equipment only and not required to be accessible.
Functional and barrier-free requirements for each facility shall be clearly defined. Considerations of mobility restrictions, dexterity restrictions, illnesses affecting mobility, vision, hearing, and further considerations that impact daily tasks associated with the positions will be considered for further regulatory requirements for accessibility.
4.4.12Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED)
Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design, widely known as CPTED is a multi-disciplinary approach of crime prevention that uses urban and architectural design, and the management of built and natural environments. CPTED strategies aim to reduce crime by manipulating the physical environment for the purpose of influencing certain desired human behavior, resulting in reduced criminal behavior. CPTED is a strategy that recognizes the relationship that exists between the built environment and incidence of crime.
In open public spaces such as a metro or train stations, crime and the perception of personal safety are key considerations that directly influence customer experience, function, and ridership numbers. Proper design and effective use of the built environment can lead to a reduction in the incidence and fear of crime by deterring criminal behavior. These behavioral effects can be accomplished by manipulating the physical environment to eliminate areas that could have the possibility to support criminal behavior.
For CPTED to be successful, the designer must be able to anticipate, recognize and appraise risks of crime to initiate control or actions to remove or reduce these risks. There are three (3) main concepts of CPTED: natural surveillance, natural access control and territorial reinforcement. Natural surveillance and access control strategies limit the opportunity for crime and territorial reinforcement promotes social control through a variety of measures.
4.4.12.1Natural Surveillance
Natural surveillance involves the design and placement of physical features, activities, and people to increase the perceived risk of attempting criminal activity by improving visibility of potential offenders to the public. This allows for fostering positive social interaction among users of private/public space and helps promote casual observation which increases a sense of defensible space that discourages undesirable activity. The design should allow for natural observation from the street to the station, from station to the street and between uses.
4.4.12.2Natural Access Control
Natural access control aims to limit the opportunity for crime by decreasing access opportunities through use of physical and symbolic barriers. These barriers can attract, channel, and control the movement of people and allow for more controlled surveillance to minimize opportunity for crime. Access barriers can be placed through use of landforms, pathways, and landscaping. Some of the more direct forms are fences, gates, bollards, and camera surveillance.
4.4.12.3Territorial Reinforcement
Territorial reinforcement aims to promote social control through defined types of spaces to promote sense of ownership. Taking measures to apply this concept allows the normal user to feel safe and make the potential offender to stand out and easier to identify. This can be achieved through use of building design, unique paving and surfaces, screening, signage, and landscape. It is considered that design of an area is far better communicator than just signage.
4.4.13Durability
A 100-year design service life for building structures and structural components shall be used in addition to Part C of Schedule C6, section A.3.5 – Design Components and Design Life as applicable. This service life corresponds to the long-life category as indicated by CSA S478-2010 – Guideline on Durability of Buildings. In addition, Table 10 (based on Table A.3-1 of Schedule C6 of PA) dictates the following design life requirements:
Table 10: Design Life Requirements

Predicted service life for each component is to be demonstrated based on the Durability Tables which correspond to CSA S478 Tables A1, A2 and A3. These tables will be revised periodically as more information is obtained about the station assemblies.
Typically, components with service lives shorter than the design service life of the overall station, can be readily replaced. Using Table 3 in CSA S478-2010 – Guideline on Durability in Buildings, we have developed Table 11 as a guide for the BoD:
Table 11: Failure Category and Requirement for Components

All stations require regular maintenance to maintain integrity of its components. We do not anticipate any exceptional maintenance requirements for the first 10 years of the project’s occupancy. Capital planning is an important part of the ongoing maintenance of a station. This exercise ensures that costs are allocated for future restoration work and maintenance activities. Capital planning allows owners to be proactive rather than reactive, and to plan restoration work which will provide the durability intended during design. ONxpress suggests completing a capital plan as part of the station commissioning process.
4.5Building Envelope Design Criteria
To be confirmed for DDS.
4.6Interior Design Criteria
To be confirmed for DDS.
4.7Landscaping Scope Delineation
Landscape scope delineation for Line Stations includes all planting, seeding, and sodding, site furnishings such as benches, waste receptacles, bike racks, and salt bins, fencing outside of the platform areas, and bollards separating vehicular and pedestrian traffic as required. Hardscape including pedestrian paving areas is assumed to be completed under Civil Engineering’s scope, though it is recommended that Landscape Architecture have input into unit paving selections if required. It is assumed that all guard rails and railings associated with platform works are to be completed under the Architectural scope. It is also assumed that any stairs/ramps and associated railings will be completed by Architectural and/or the Civil Engineering disciplines.
4.8Landscaping Design Criteria
Technical approach and requirements of overall landscape architectural works will meet the PA Schedule C6. Standard drawing submissions shall include:
Limits of tree protection fencing.
Limits, locations and materials of station entrance, walkways, site furniture, security fencing.
Planting Plans indicating species and quantities.
Details for proposed landscape items and materials.
Referencing information from other packages includes:
BIM environment.
4.8.1Site Furnishings
Site furniture is comprised of a family of site furnishing complementary to interior station furniture and as identified in GO DRM 2020.
Furnishing will be located adjacent to sidewalk and along planforms to contribute to passenger wayfinding.
4.8.2Fencing
Fencing requirements shall strictly adhere to the GO DRM.
4.8.3Planting
Planting has been designed to define along pathways, and to enhance natural areas adjacent the site. Planting is specified in accordance with Canadian Standards for Nursery, relevant municipal standard details as required, and MX standard details, MX Vegetation Guidelines, and GO DRM 2020 as applicable.
4.8.4Tree Protection Fencing
Tree protection measures shall adhere to MX Vegetation guidelines within the right-of-way and the applicable municipal requirements and by-laws when not on MX property.
4.9Sustainability Scope Delineation
The Master Sustainability Plan for OnCorr is under development and is scheduled to be issued as a draft in the spring of 2023. The Master Sustainability Plan will outline all program-wide sustainability design criteria and will be applied to the entire spectrum of site facilities as identified by individual stations (i.e., platforms, canopy and shelters, pedestrian bridges, and ancillary buildings).
4.10Sustainability Design Criteria
The Master Sustainability Plan will adhere to the PA and MX Go Transit Design Standards. The MX Design Standards and GO Design Requirements Manual are strongly influenced by global sustainable design best practices such as green building certifications, sustainability performance standards, and code requirements for buildings and infrastructure developments. Although still under review, sustainability criteria outlined in the Master Sustainability Plan will be developed and informed by some of the following benchmarking tools and/or standards; DS-05 Sustainable Design Standards, LEED Certification, the Envision Sustainable Infrastructure Framework, SB-10 Code Energy Modeling, the Toronto Green Standard, and other Municipal Local Code Compliance. The Master Sustainability Plan will act as a framework to set performance objectives and targets for energy and carbon emissions, climate adaptability and resilience, material impact, and resource allocations.
4.11Urban Planning Scope Delineation
The scope of work for Line Stations is limited to renovations or modifications to the existing GO stations. The urban planning scope includes regulation of the uses of space that focus on the physical form, economic functions, and social impacts of the urban environment and on the location surrounding each station. Planning also includes the manner and style by which buildings are laid out and the design of public places. Urban planning has adopted a focus on the social and environmental bottom-lines that focus on planning as a tool to improve the health and well-being of people while maintaining sustainability standards.
4.12Urban Planning Design Criteria
The urban planning team does not provide any design services. The urban planning services relate primarily to due diligence. This includes reviewing and providing information on policy applicable to the site, such as: Official Plans, Secondary Plans, Zoning Reviews and Urban Design guidelines. It also involves either leading or supporting any required Planning Act applications (site plan application, minor variance, rezoning, etc.,).
4.13Code Compliance Scope Delineation
The requirements in the OBC relative to fire protection, occupant safety and accessibility will be reviewed as part of the Code compliance scope of work. The submission requirements in PA Schedule C6 C-1.1 (d) and (e) will be addressed, which include (but not limited to) the following:
Occupancy classification.
Part 11 application relative to major occupancy and occupant load.
Construction requirement with respect to combustibility of material and fire resistance rating.
Spatial separation assessment.
Occupant load for egress calculations.
Egress location and capacity.
Provide the applicable requirements for fire alarm, lighting, public address, sprinkler, and standpipe systems specified in Part 3 of the OBC.
Barrier-free design requirements.
4.14Code Compliance Design Criteria
A preliminary code compliance assessment is conducted to review the applicable fire protection and life safety design requirements and identify alternative means for compliance where required.
4.14.1Codes and Standards
The code compliance assessment for all existing stations is conducted based on the 2012 Ontario Building Code (OBC, O.Reg. 332/12 as amended to O.Reg. 451/22), as the locally applicable Code, except for Pearson Station where the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC 2020) is the applicable building code. PA Schedule C6, 2021 is reviewed for project specific requirements. Pearson Station code compliance design criteria will be addressed under a separate cover.
4.14.2OBC Part 11 Application
Where an existing building is altered, the performance level is to be maintained at least equal to that of the existing construction while any new construction is subject to the current code requirements. This permits existing conditions without retroactive application of current building code requirements. As such, existing platforms or station buildings that are not part of the proposed renovations are not required to be upgraded to meet the current OBC. Part 11 of OBC will be reviewed to assess reduction in performance level (if any) and determine systems that require further consideration.
4.14.3Approach to Compliance
GO Transit is an inter-regional public transit system in Southern Ontario, with rail operations serving several communities. The GO rail operations are classified as commuter rail systems and therefore application of OBC 3.13, rapid transit station requirements for construction and fire-life safety design, are not considered appropriate for the GO station buildings/platforms. The station buildings are required to comply with OBC Part 3 as a passenger station/depot.
For platforms in RER GO stations that are constructed as slabs-on-grade provided with passenger shelters (acting as weather protection for occupants) and no canopy over the platform/tracks, the applicable requirements are not clearly defined in the building code. The following sections intend to provide a high-level OBC compliance path proposed to address the construction, spatial separation, means of egress, accessibility, and other fire safety system requirements for such platforms (hereafter referred to as “Platform”). A more detailed report will be completed for each station as the design evolves.
The fire-life safety requirements applicable for tunnels or bridges will be developed as the design progresses.
4.14.4Construction Requirements
The structure assemblies for the new Platforms (constructed as slab on grade) are not required to have a fire resistance rating. The construction requirements for Platform slab over the underground walkway (tunnel) and the new Platform shelters will be determined as the design progresses.
4.14.5Open-Air Storey
The Platforms (including tracks) are open to the ambient environment with no roof, canopy or wall assemblies enclosing the space, thus allowing smoke or heat to dispersion into the atmosphere. As such, the Platforms are classified as an open-air storey as per the OBC.
4.14.6Spatial Separation
The Platforms are classified as an open-air storey and intended to have limited combustible content that do not constitute a significant fire exposure hazard for adjacent buildings or properties. Therefore, with reference to the provisions in OBC Article 3.2.3.10, no protection is required for exposure from the Platform to adjacent buildings or properties.
4.14.7Fire Alarm System and Public Address System
OBC Clause 3.2.4.1.(2)(d) does not require a fire alarm system in an open-air seating area. The fire hazards on the Platform have similar characteristics to an open-air seating area where egress points are controlled (like aisles or benched seats), smoke can vent directly to atmosphere, and limited bounding walls are enclosing the structure. As such, a fire alarm system is not required to serve the Platform. Consequently, a public address system is not required (OBC 3.2.4.24.(1)).
PA Schedule C6, C.1.5.(f)(vii) K requires integrated single stage fire alarm system to be provided. PA Schedule C6, C.1.5.(f)(vii) I requires the existing public address system to be extended to the new construction. Specific design requirements for the fire alarm and public address system will be determined as the design progresses.
4.14.8Provisions for Firefighting
The existing fire department access route to the stations will be maintained. Where a new access route is required, design is to comply with OBC Article 3.2.5.6. Each station and the proposed construction will be reviewed to determine the access requirement.
A standpipe system is not required on the Platforms. A sprinkler system is not required on the Platforms or the new shelters.
4.14.9Egress Assessment
The following sections address egress requirements for a train fire scenario when the train is at the Platform for the purposes of loading or unloading of passengers.
4.14.9.1Occupant Load Calculation
The train operations and functionality that contributes to the occupant load in the building is more suitably addressed by OBC section 3.13. Provisions in OBC Subclause 3.1.17.1.(1)(c)(i) acknowledges the use of an occupancy specific methodology to determine the occupant load.
The Platform occupant load is calculated based on hourly ridership (boarding passengers and link load), train capacity and operating headway. A surge factor of 1.3 and missed headway factor of 2 are applied to the boarding and link loads as per OBC Sentences 3.13.4.1.(4) and (5).
The maximum Platform occupant load will be calculated considering the following scenarios:
For a single side Platform serving single direction: the platform occupancy is calculated as the sum of the boarding and maximum link load multiplied by the surge factor and missed headway factor.
For a single side Platform serving both directions (one train can alight at a time): the platform occupancy is calculated as the sum of:
The boarding and maximum link load for the more onerous incident line multiplied by the surge factor and the missed headway factor.
The boarding load of the non-incident line multiplied by the surge factor and missed headway factor.
The occupant load calculation will be determined for simultaneous evacuation of the boarding and link loads during the peak period. The peak period is the greater of the a.m. or p.m. total occupant load.
4.14.9.2Means of Egress Number, Location and Capacity
PA Schedule C6: C.1.1(d)(ii) requires compliance with the methodology of OBC 3.13 for egress, passenger flow rates (to calculate platform clearance time) and travel distance. Referring to OBC 3.13 for calculation of egress capacity and travel distance is appropriate considering the operational aspect of the system. However, where compliance with the prescriptive OBC 3.13 requirements is challenging due to structural or construction difficulties, compliance is proposed to be achieved through a performance-based design approach which is briefly described below.
A protected route is defined as “portion of a means of egress that starts at a point where the passengers would not be vulnerable to exposure from a train fire and that leads to the exterior of the station or through an exit to an adjacent building”. The protected route can be considered at the point of leaving the platform in an aboveground unenclosed station (OBC Sentence 3.13.4.2.(6)). It is proposed to consider a platform location that is demonstrated through an engineering analysis to be a protected route for the purposes of the egress assessment. The analysis will include evaluating potential radiant exposure, platform geometry, and natural ventilation provisions for the Platforms.
Travel distance will be measured from the most remote point on the Platform to an exit or a “protected route” (OBC 3.13.4.3.(5)). Exit flow factors provided in OBC Table 3.13.4.5 are used to determine the platform clearance time. The platform clearance time to a “protected route” will be determined for each Platform based on the architectural layout and the calculated occupant load.
4.14.10Barrier-Free Design
A barrier-free access is required to all areas of the new Platform construction or extension. Service areas and elevator machine rooms are not required to be provided with a barrier-free path of travel (OBC 3.8.2.1.(3)). Some of the barrier-free access design requirements applicable to the new construction are as follows.
Minimum width of doors or doorways: 860 mm (OBC 3.8.3.3.(1)).
Minimum width of barrier-free path of travel: 1,100 mm (OBC 3.8.1.3.(1)).
All new floors or walking surfaces in a barrier-free path of travel having a slope steeper than 1:20 are required to be design as ramps conforming to OBC 3.8.3.4. Additional barrier-free design requirements will be provided as the design progresses.
4.14.11Other OBC Requirements
Some of the other OBC requirements applicable to the Platform are listed below.
The emergency lighting system is required to provide an average and a minimum illumination level of 10 lux and 1 lux, respectively throughout the new construction.
Exit signs are required throughout the proposed construction conforming to OBC 3.4.5.1.
4.15Pedestrian Flow Analysis Criteria
4.15.1Performance Criteria
The performance criteria for a good quality customer experience in the public circulation areas of the stations include:
Promoting direct routes for short access/egress times.
Promoting universally accessible and intuitive routing for natural wayfinding.
Minimizing potential for conflict between flows.
Providing human-scale integration into the surrounding streetscape.
Minimizing impacts to access/egress during construction.
The required densities refer to the peak 15-minute average across key areas, with the understanding that peak moments within the peak period (i.e., when a train alights), and specific locations (i.e., the bases of stairs and near faregates) may operate at higher densities while providing good overall performance. Meanwhile, higher densities in areas with cross flows should be avoided. Analysis will demonstrate that no greater than 10% of the platform would exceed LOS D when measured as an average, based on cumulative mean density, over a 5-minute period. The 5-minute period will start 2.5-minutes prior to the train arrival and end 2.5-minutes after train arrival. In addition to density analysis, time studies will be completed to show compliance to platform clearance where platforms are to be clear of all alighting passengers prior to the arrival of subsequent trains.
Level of Service (LOS) is used to examine the quality of the environment in terms of pedestrian space. It is used in the evaluation of walkways, stairways and queuing. LOS ranges from LOS A, where a pedestrian can freely select a walking speed, bypass slower moving pedestrians, and avoid crossing conflicts, to LOS F, where a pedestrian’s walking speed is extremely restricted, and forward progress can only be made by shuffling movements. The LOS is calculated using John J. Fruin’s standards based on density, space, and flow and applies to both static and dynamic analysis methods. See Table 12, and Table 13 for more detailed information. Table 14 illustrates the minimum LOS at different elements.

4.15.2Ridership
Complete station ridership information has not been provided in the contract documents. Instead, passenger capacity levels have been provided in Part A – General Requirements, Schedule A-4 – Passenger Service Requirements. The information provided in the contract documents represents peak capacity levels for inbound and outbound service. It is therefore necessary to supplement the data with historic information when forecasting has not been provided. Ridership for each station will be derived for Service level 1 through level 32 where level 32 (year 2056) will be used for ultimate buildout and level 7 (year 2031) will be used for early service. Intermediate service levels will be used for construction conditions as required.
Since capacity levels were provided instead of station specific ridership values, it is necessary to supplement the data with historic information. Historic information will be taken from background document F2017 Cordon Count Weekday which was supplied by MX. The Cordon count data will be increased to match the growth rates used in the A-4 – Passenger Service Requirements. A summary of which value type will be used for each time period is shown in Table 15 where values “A-4…” and “Off-Peak…” come from the contract and “historic counts” comes from 2017 counts.

Train schedules will be taken from the CJV provided CS2 and CS5 service levels dated December 16, 2022. The peak 15-minute period will be 30% of the peak hour ridership. This ensures that the peak 15-minute trains are 20% greater ridership than the average over the hour.
4.15.3Analysis
4.15.3.1Static Calculations
Passenger flow analysis will be completed using a excel based spread sheet analysis where LOS and Platform clear time will be calculated using standards and methodology set out by J.J Fruin. Critical areas such as platforms and vertical circulation elements will be evaluated using this method to set a baseline compliance review. The static calculation will review the peak 15-minute period for all circulation elements along with a 5-minute peak to evaluate platforms and platform circulation elements.
Analysis for the peak 15-minute period will assume that boardings and alighting’s are evenly distributed while the 5-minute period assumes strategic arrivals as well as strategic positioning in the train.
For the 5-minute passenger demands, the total boarding shall be derived from all departing trains during that period distributed across a 5-minute period, such that the peak 1-minute flow is 20% of the 5-minute. The Alighting demands will be concentrated to a 1-minute period where the concentrate is a result from strategic passenger positioning withing a train. This concentration as a general practice would range between 50% and 80% of ridership and will depend on station layout and train length.
4.15.4Modelling
Passenger Modelling for existing station renovations will be completed with PTV Vissim/VisWalk for the service levels and time periods stated. If the train headway less than 8 trains per hour, it is assumed passengers plan arrivals to coincide with the train arrival. This is based on data provided by the transit capacity research board along with observations made at existing GO transit stations.
Boarding passengers are assumed to strategically locate on platform based on destination station. Riders will typically locate themselves within the train to minimize horizontal travel time at their destination station. For this same reason, alighting passengers will be concentrated around circulation elements and thus alighting passengers in the modelling will be distributed within the train to reflect this desired concentration.
Modelling outputs will include heatmaps based on cumulative median for the peak 15-minute and peak 5-minute periods along with density histograms to demonstrate compliance to platform densities. Modelling outputs will also include clearance time charts and travel time reports. Additional model outputs will be completed as required depending on specific station requirements.
The model outputs will be used along with static calculations to complete the Pedestrian Movement Modelling Analysis (PMMA) as required by C6.
Modelling will include analysis for all internal station elements including platforms and circulation elements. However, the modelling will exclude sideways, PUDO, and horizontal elements outside station buildings or platform areas. The following assumptions will be used for all modelling including static and dynamic models:
1.Passengers do not occupy the tactile warning strip at the edge of the Platform except when boarding or alighting a train.
2.Passengers do not wait within any designated No Standing Zones.
3.The PMMA complies with Schedule A-5 – Safety and System Assurance.
Pedestrian behaviour and social force are attributes applied in VisWalk models that affect pedestrian decisions. Each parameter in the social force model will cause a pedestrian in the simulation to make a choice based on expected travel times and crowd avoidance. The social forces will change as pedestrians travel the station area and encounter crowds and obstacles. Depending on the environment and goal of each pedestrian, the behaviour parameters are modified to accurately reflect how pedestrian may act in specific environments and are calibrated based on historical data. Agents in the model will have parameters listed in Table 16.

This includes construction of new platforms and related service buildings to adjusting the current construction of the platform to align with the track design and operation requirement of ONxpress.
Structural design solution provided is dependent on extent of such modifications needed at these stations as well as the construction constraint in carrying out the construction. The design as such remains performance compliant with requirements stipulated in Part C of C6. This BoD also ensure that design complies with the requirements defined in OBC, NBC, AASHTO and MX DRM as well as material codes such as CSA A23.3, CSA S-16, etc. The criteria include the basic framework regarding design loads, material properties, durability considerations and structural member selection criteria. It also describes the structural system for gravity and lateral forces acting on these structural systems.
This section only details out design in relation to permanent structures. For temporary works, refer to temporary works package drawings.
5.1Structural Scope Delineation
The structural design has following inputs from other disciplines:
1.Architectural: Overall station layout, room sizes, elevations, gridlines, assignment of slopes, confirmation of column location and confirmation of structural element sizes and shapes, Slab / deck edge drawings, space limitations, indication of any preferred build material (as applicable), consideration of passive protection for platform and future build scenarios. Acceptance of movements produced by structures.
2.Geotechnical / Hydrogeological: Site specific geo-engineering reports to provide soil and rock parameters, applicable foundation design types and design values, seismic parameters, environmental results for excess soil groundwater quality, applicable groundwater conditions / elevations for foundation / structural design.
3.Drainage Engineer: Drainage plans, location and indication of pipe sizes, location of pits / trenches, provision of slopes for drainage.

5.4.1Reinforced Concrete
Reinforced concrete elements are designed to meet the requirements of CSA A23.3. Such design is to comply with the performance requirements of CSA A23.1 including the reinforcement covers to mitigate the environmental exposure effects. All the platform surfaces, pedestrian pathways etc. are considered exposed to de-icing chemicals and so for any RC concrete design for such elements considers C-1 exposure.
Minimum concrete compressive strength shall be 35MPa and 30MPa at 28-days for C-1 and N/F-2 exposure classes, respectively.
Reinforcement steel bars shall be conforming to:
CAN / CSA G30.18, Grade 400R or 400W.
Minimum yield strength of 400MPa.
Welded wire mesh shall be CAN / CSA G30.5.
5.4.2Structural Steel

For Hollow Structural Sections: 350W (Class “C” or “H”), ASTM A1085 Grade 50 (345MPa) or ASTM A500 (Grade “C”).
Galvanized Steel Deck: ASTM A653M Grade A or B.
5.5Design Considerations
Structural design follows the criteria provided in PA Schedule C6 section C.1.1.5(d) for Line Stations. Design Loads (and load combinations), deflection / settlement criteria for structural systems as well as individual structural elements like foundations, floors, and roofs comply with the requirement in PA Schedule C6 section C.1.1.5(d).
5.5.1Design Life and Importance Category
Per Table A.3.1 of Schedule C6 of PA, station structures are designed for a design life of 100 years. Stand-alone OCS structure (not integrated with station structures) and their foundations are designed for design life of 75 years. Tunnels are to be designed for a design life of 100 years.
Per clause C.1.1.5(d)(i) A. of Schedule C6 of PA Importance category is considered “Normal” for all structural design.
5.5.2Durability
Per clause C.1.1.5(d) (vi) B. of Schedule C6 of PA, the following protections are compiled by for Building elements:
CAN/CSA S413 Parking Structures requirements for concrete elements and reinforcing steel susceptible to corrosion:
Concrete Exposure classification shall be provided on structural drawings in due consideration to specific location of the line station and the environment it must operate in (per C.1.1.5(d) (v) A (v) of Schedule C6 of PA). For all the walking surfaces of the RC elements that acts as platforms, pedestrian walkways, pedestrian bridges, etc. C-1 exposure class is considered. (Additionally, per same clause C.1.1.5(d) (v) A (v) of Schedule C6 of PA, C-1 Exposure Class is assigned for floor pits, pit walls, track slabs and concrete pedestals supporting the tracks).
Concrete covers are adjusted per Concrete Exposure classes as mentioned above. This is done per CSA A23.1 Table 1 and Table 17. Such adjustment of the cover values considers if the concrete surface is expected to undergo cyclic variations of temperature (e.g., freeze-thaw cycles) or temperature control would be in place.
Epoxy coated reinforcement is not used. Also, the structural design specifications prohibit use of calcium chloride in concrete mixes (And admixture for concrete) when steel reinforcement or metal embeds are to be used. This follows C.1.1.5(d) (v) A (iv) of Schedule C6 of PA.
All structural steel for parts not exposed to weather shall be receiving prime coat per CISC / CPMA standard 2-75. This is included in the structural specifications.
All such parts of the structural steel that are exposed to weather (including the connections) shall be hot dip galvanized in accordance with CSA G164. This shall be included in the structural specification. Structural drawing notes shall clarify such locations.
The structural design specification for concrete mix is performance based to ensure appropriate safeguard against issues like sulphate attack and carbonation. The general notes on structural drawings for each of the line station clarify if there is such chance of sulphate attack based on geo-engineering input for that location.

5.5.3.1.2Construction Loads
A uniform load of 1.0kPa is considered as a provision for construction load for checking the permanent structures construction.
5.5.3.2Temperature Loads
Following the requirements in clause A.2.5(a) of Schedule C6 of PA, the ambient conditions are to vary between +44°C and -40°C. It also requires that relative humidity level to vary between 20% to 100% (non-condensing conditions). Sliding joints shall be provided in platform canopy to mitigate the effects of temperature difference.
5.5.3.3Train Loads
Per clause A-3.3 (e) of Schedule C6 of PA, the train live load surcharge shall be based on Cooper E-80 loading in compliance with AREMA manual, Volume 2 – Structures.
As the line stations are not considered enclosed structure, and in absence of any related North American code / standard to make related calculations, the air pressure from train is calculated based using Section 6.6 of Eurocode EN 1991-2:2003 Action of Structure Part 2: Traffic Loads on Bridges. Canopies, entrance structures for pedestrian bridge / tunnel and other structural elements on the platform that are subjected to train wind pressure are designed to resist a minimum uniform pressure of ± 0.20 kPa (To be confirmed) on horizontal and vertical surfaces. All cladding and non-structural elements are also designed for such load.
5.5.3.4Lateral Loads
5.5.3.4.1Wind Loads
Clause A.2.5(a) of C6 requires that applicable maximum wind continuous velocity is 65km/h (equivalent to 18.05m/s) with wind gusts at 120km/h (equivalent to 33.33m/s). While PA does not explicitly clarify, it is considered that above mentioned continuous wind velocity is the maximum mean hourly wind speed with a probability of exceedance of 2% in 50 years (which makes it evaluated on comparable basis for OBC and NBC).
For building structures design this shall be compared with the localized wind speed provided by OBC / NBC and most stringent requirement shall be used to assess wind load for that location.
Following shall be used for location specific wind load calculations:
Cg = 2.00.
Cp = 0.8 (windward), 0.5 (leeward); to be used for building structures as conservative loads.
CpCg = per OBC 4.1.7.6 where applicable.
Ce = (h/10)0.2 ≥ 0.9.
Iw = 1.0 for ULS and 0.75 for SLS, wind importance factor, category normal.
5.5.3.4.2Seismic Loads
Seismic load parameters are established per NBC 2020 for each line station. The geo-engineering report shall provide soil characterization (for example, shear wave velocity in soil) for each station. This would in turn provide the ordinates for target response spectra and Peak Ground Acceleration value. The structural design shall be based on such spectra that has a 2% probability of exceedance in 50 years.
5.5.4Load Combinations
ULS and SLS load combinations are based on NBC 2020. Such ULS load combinations are as follows:
1.1.4D.
2.1.25D	+ 1.5L		(Companion Load: 1.0S or 0.4W).
3.0.9D	+ 1.5L		(Companion Load: 1.0S or 0.4W).
4.1.25D	+ 1.5S		(Companion Load: 1.0L or 0.4W).
5.0.9D	+ 1.5S		(Companion Load: 1.0L or 0.4W).
6.1.25D	+ 1.4W		(Companion Load: 0.5L or 0.5S).
7.0.9D	+ 1.4W		(Companion Load: 0.5L or 0.5S).
8.1.0D	+ 1.0E		(Companion Load: 0.5L or 0.25S).
9.A load of 1.5H and / or 1.25T (as applicable) is added to above load combinations to seek worst case load scenario.
Similarly, the SLS load combinations are provided in the following. These are to be used for evaluating deflection of structure (or structural components). Such deflections would be checked for portion of deflection applicable after installation of such components which are under review.
1.When creep is not involved:
i)1.00D	+ 1.00L				(Companion Load: 0.30W or 0.35S).
ii)1.00D	+ 1.00W			(Companion Load: 0.35L or 0.35S).
iii)1.00D	+ 1.00S				(Companion Load: 0.30W or 0.35L).
2.When creep is involved:
iv)1.00D	+ 1.00Ls +1.00Lt	(Companion Load: 0.30W or 0.35S).
v)1.00D	+ 1.00W			(Companion Load: 0.35L or 0.35S).
vi)1.00D	+ 1.00S				(Companion Load: 0.30W or 0.35L).
Where:
D = Dead Load.
E = Earthquake Load.
H = Permanent Lateral pressure from soil including groundwater.
L = Live Load.
Ls = Sustained Portion of live load, L.
Lt = Transitory portion of the live load, L.

5.5.5Serviceability Criteria
5.5.5.1Vertical Deflection Limits
Table 23 clarifies applicable deflection limits to serve as serviceability criteria.
Table 23: Structural Serviceability Criteria
Measure
Limit
Description
Roof Vertical deflection due to live load – applicable to steel framing with no concrete build ups.
Span / 360
Steel roof framing elements are to be evaluated against this limit. All building services, interior partitions and alike are to be detailed to ensure such margin is provided underneath the roof to accommodate such movement.
Concrete based floor and beams vertical deflection
Structural and Non-structural elements that sits on or are present below such RC construction are evaluated. Applicable Live Load deflections and total deflections are applicable to all the elements. For incremental deflections, Masonry, and glass walls (windows) which are connected top and bottom, a limit of Span/480 is used; otherwise, it is considered span / 360 (and in such cases detailing of these elements would have such movement margins).
Due to immediate live load effect
Span / 360

Due to total load of gravity loads (including the creep on sustained portions of gravity loads)
Span / 240

Incremental Deflection after installation of building component under investigation (includes deflection from creep after such installation)
Span / 360 if the elements are not susceptible to be damaged or cracked. For elements like masonry walls that are susceptible to cracking, the applicable limit is Span / 480.

Foundations

Refer to Section 5.6.
5.5.5.2Lateral Deflections / Inter-story Drift Limits
Lateral drifts are checked for wind and seismic forces as following:
5.5.5.3Wind Drift
The lateral force resisting system is designed based on the following criteria:
Maximum building drift:		H / 500.
Maximum inter-story drift:	h / 500.
Where,	H =Total building height.
h = Floor-to-floor height.
5.5.5.4Seismic Drift
Inter-story drift under seismic loads is limited as h / 40, where h = Floor-to-floor height.
5.6Foundations Design Criteria
Foundations are structurally designed to meet the geotechnical acceptance in terms of settlement and bearing capacity.
In general, shallow foundations (strip footings and isolated pad footings) are used for construction of platform elements. For portions supporting the pedestrian bridges, it is anticipated to have concrete caissons in general. However, besides these general guidelines, the actual foundation type is selected based on the geo-engineering design input applicable to a specific line station site and so adaptation is possible as the site may require.
Applicable groundwater elevations are picked up from information and coordination provided by geotechnical, hydrogeological, and civil design and is considered as design input for structural design of the foundations. Additionally, the groundwater quality is also checked to verify the applicable Environmental Exposure class in terms of chloride and sulphate issues.
The seismic inputs provided for a specific location in the related geo-engineering report is also used for seismic design of the foundation and related structural detailing extent per OBC section 4.1.8.16 and 4.2.
5.7Structural Systems
5.7.1Platform Canopy
Platform canopy makes use of moment framed steel construction. The roof is metal deck (or glass – Confirmation needed from CJV / MX) supported by steel beams. To facilitate construction and transportation, canopy roof frames are modules of almost 7m length that are connected to the steel columns that are erected at site individually. These steel modules are designed to handles loading from build-up needed for signage as well as miscellaneous metal secondary framing to create roof final shape (conformation of canopy concept is pending to be coordinated with CJV / MX).
When OCS posts are located within the length of canopy construction on the platform, they are integrated withing the canopy construction. At such locations, the steel modular construction mentioned above is adapted to cater for localized high forces from OCS system.
The total length of the canopy is structurally divided to account for thermal loads by providing expansion joints in the roofing frames.
5.7.2Platform Shelters
Platform shelters are designed per specific details provided in standard MX drawings for shelters. The Canopy framing (refer to GO Stations Common Elements - Feasibility Study Multidisciplinary Report in the section below) is adapted for this reason.
5.7.3Pedestrian Bridge
Structurally, a pedestrian bridge is divided into three (3) parts, separated by expansion joints. The bridge span itself is placed to sit on steel beams provided within “entrance structure” on each side of the bridge span. This bridge span is thus provided with a rolling support on one (1) side and is pinned on the other.
The bridge span is a trussed structure that would be lifted in its place with precast planks installed for floor and metal deck provided to act as roof. Rest of the attachments including the façade would be added to the structure in position.
Each of the bridge entrance structure houses a staircase and an elevator with actual bride seating in the middle of the two. This entrance structure is a braced frame construction in both directions. Underneath the bridge location, the braces are provided along the platform.
Along the platform, the structure gains elevation as it provides space for precast stairs. This precast construction is supported at every 7m interval on top of three (3) cross bracing. Two (2) more cross bracings are provided at each side of the elevator. Refer to Structural drawings for this typical pedestrian bridge.
Below the stairs, rooms are provided for platform storage, telecom, electrical, elevator control equipment and sump for elevator. These rooms are created by adding block masonry construction for walls and steel metal deck supported on steel framing as roof. At platform level, these rooms are designated for minimum uniform 7.2kPa Live Load (or actual equipment loads).
5.7.4Ancillary Buildings
Ancillary buildings are service buildings that are located per specific site location and are normally slightly away but in proximity to platforms. There are three (3) modules of such buildings prepared (depending on and on a single location, one of these modules is being used.
For such buildings, roof consists of steel deck supported on steel joists which run in smaller direction of the building. Steel beams, running on periphery, support the steel joists. Moment frames are provided for lateral forces. This is applicable in both directions. Refer to structural drawings for layout and framing.
Service buildings are provided with isolated mat foundations that have minimum cover of frost protection (generally, 1.2 m but would be selected based on specific location of the station). If shallower foundations are used, rigid insulation to be provided for the equivalent cover. Interconnecting grade beams along periphery and at location of vertical braces in short direction connect the foundation pads.
The floor of the building is cast in place RC slab on grade. At certain locations thickening is provided when needed to support larger load values like masonry partitions, equipment requirements, etc.

In case of Pearson Station, which is currently an enclosed station, the investigations will be performed to identify the status of existing mechanical emergency ventilation system.
6.11.3Discussion
As shown in a typical section view in Figure 19 for Danforth Station, and similarly for Stouffville, Maple and Bradford Station, the passenger platforms are not within station buildings. As such, any smoke and hot gas in the platforms disperse to the atmosphere without ducting, without accumulation in occupied areas, and without impacting tenability in egress routes. The stations don’t need to be equipped with a mechanical ventilation to control smoke propagation. If required by MX, CFD analysis can be performed on a case-by-case basis.

To evaluate existing service’s available capacities to new loads, Project Co will review all the as-built drawings and will verify them via site visits. Also, the average demand load of the station will be determined using a year of Hydro bills. Having the as-builts, site visits, and Hydro bills information gathered, Project Co can complete the evaluation and can determine if there are any upgrades to the existing services required. In case there are not sufficient spare capacities available, then the existing services will be upgraded to accommodate the new construction in compliance with PA and DRM requirements and criteria. All the proposed upgrades to be in coordination with utility, architectural, structural, mechanical, and civil disciplines to provide a seamless design.

Communications System for Line Stations will consist of multiple subsystems connected over the station local network. Such subsystems are CCTV, Security, PA, Digital Signs, Telephony/Intercoms, Data, and Wi-Fi. Where applicable, all IP-connected devices will be PoE-powered.
Each system will consist of end devices (e.g., intercom or camera) typically connected over copper cable (e.g., CAT6A) to local mini hub room or cabinet on the platform. The purpose of mini hub rooms is to connect all local devices within 90-m of range (CAT6A limitation), so to significantly decrease the use of fiber cable and media converters usage for remote devices. If there is a space limitation on the platform and mini hub rooms cannot fit, there is an option to use a cabinet with the same purpose.
Below is brief description for each of the systems’ connectivity.
It should be noted that based on C6 scope interpretation, as well as typical MX station design for Comms, SCADA system design for Line Stations is assumed to be included as part of BAS and developed by others (typically Mechanical). There are few monitoring points within Security System (as detailed below) which will be developed under Communications, which is also aligned with C6 and current MX practices.
7.9.2.1CCTV System
CCTV system will consist of CCTV cameras and local Network Video Recorder (NVR); CCTV cameras will use CAT6A cable for connection or local mini hub room or cabinet on the platform, where they will terminate on a copper patch panel and connect to local network switch. From there, CCTV signal will be transferred over to Main Comms Room network, where it will ultimately end on the local NVR. All cameras will be PoE-powered.
7.9.2.2Security System
Security system will consist of:
Intrusion access control system (IAC) for doors in form of keypad/card readers, audio alarms, electric strikes etc.
Various sensors and monitoring points across the station: smoke detectors, sump pump monitoring, low and high temperature etc., as described in C6., whose signal will be going to MX Security provider Chubb.
IAC panel will exist in every mini hub room, in order to terminate local IAC devices; the panel will connect to local network switch, and then connected over to the Main Comms Room. Monitoring and control of all IAC points will be done remotely from MX NOC.
Further refinement of various sensors and monitoring points, and clear separation and interface between BAS and Security system will be done during the design phase.
7.9.2.3PA System
PA System will consist of speakers arranged across the station, and redundant pair of Network Audio Controllers (NAC) in the main comms room. Depending on the station configuration and consequent length of speaker wiring, pair of NACs may be included in the mini hub rooms as well. PA system will be designed with full redundancy in mind, as per the following.
Speaker will be assigned into a Zone (group of speakers covering certain station area), with each Zone being covered by two (2) speaker loops, loop A and loop B. Each speaker loop within a zone will be connected to a separate NAC channel.
In case of a failure of NAC, one of the loops in the zone will be lost, but another loop from the same zone will continue to provide the PA coverage since it’s connected to different NAC. Similar is valid in case of whole loop failure; in this case, there will always be redundant coverage from another NAC, or from another loop.
7.9.2.4Digital Signs
Digital Signs scope includes provision of cabling infrastructure, networking, as well as miscellaneous devices (HDMI converters, media players etc.). Actual locations, quantities and types of Digital Signs will be done by others, typically Architecture and/or Wayfinding.
Connectivity for Digital Signs is similar to other systems: Signs will be connected to mini hub room, and from there to Main Comms room.
7.9.2.5Telephony and Intercoms
Telephony and Intercoms will be placed across the station as described in Schedule C6, with connection to local mini hub room, and over to the Main comms room, and ultimately to MX NOC. All intercoms and IP telephones will be PoE-powered.
As a subset of telephony, analog telephone service will be provided in form of interface to Bell Canada demarcation point in the main comms room.
7.9.2.6Data Network
Data network will consist of data outlets placed inside the service rooms (for local telephones, workstations etc.) and will also serve to connect Fares and Clock devices. Actual locations, quantities and types of Fares will be done by others, typically Architecture.
Connectivity for data network is similar to other systems: data points will be connected to mini hub room, and from there to Main Comms room.
7.9.2.7Wi-Fi System
Wi-Fi system will be provided for passengers and MX staff as described in Schedule C6. It will consist of Wi-Fi Access Points (WAP), arranged across the station and Wi-Fi Controller in the main comms room. All WAPs will be PoE-powered if connected over CAT6A, or locally powered if connected over fiber cable. Design and placement of WAPs will be done after predictive site survey and analysis is performed.
7.9.3Station Network
Station network will be organized in star configuration (few mini hub rooms to main comms room) and follow 2-tier arrangement, with access and distribution switches.
All mini hub rooms will contain a pair of PoE-enabled access switches, which will connect to distribution switches in main comms room. Assumption is that Distribution switches will connect to local Station Core switch or Router, which will serve as an interface to BCN network.
Each mini hub room will connect to main comms room over 24-strand SM fiber cable, and 50-pair CAT5E copper cable, following MX Standards.

The major storm return period shall be the 100-year storm.
8.6.3Design Peak Flows
Peak flows used in the design of ditches, storm sewers, and culverts shall be determined using the Rational Method, which is expressed as follows (Ministry of Transportation Ontario, 1997):

Where:
Q = Peak runoff rate (m3/s)
C = Weighted runoff coefficient
I = Rainfall intensity corresponding to duration equal to the time of concentration (mm/hr)
A = Drainage area (ha)
The average runoff coefficient (C) for the rational equation shall be based on values shown in Table 33. Where two (2) values are shown, the higher value typically applies to steeper slopes and more impervious surfaces. For catchment areas with variable land cover conditions, a weighted runoff coefficient shall be determined.

Notes:
1. The runoff coefficients in the above table are based on Ministry of Transportation Ontario (MTO) Drainage Management Manual Design Chart 1.07.
2. The coefficients listed above are for unfrozen ground.For return periods of greater than 10 years, the values in Table 33 shall be increased as per the factors listed below to a maximum value of 1.0.
25-Year: add 10%.
50-Year: add 20%.
100-Year: add 25%.
500-Year: add 25%.
The time of concentration shall be based on either of the methods described below. The following time of concentration calculations apply to areas where predominantly sheet flow or shallow concentrated flow occurs.
The time of overland flow shall be obtained by the Bransby-Williams Formula in watersheds with a weighted runoff coefficient, C, greater than or equal to 0.40 (Ministry of Transportation Ontario, 1997):

Where:
to = Time of Overland Flow (minutes)
L = Watershed Length (m)
Sw = Watershed Slope (%)
A = Watershed Area (ha)
The time of overland flow shall be obtained by the Airport Formula in watersheds with a weighted runoff coefficient, C, less than 0.40 (Ministry of Transportation Ontario, 1997):

Where:
to = Time of Overland Flow (minutes)
C = Weighted Runoff Coefficient
L = Watershed Length (m)
S = Watershed Slope (%)
The following time of concentration calculations apply to areas where predominantly sheet flow or shallow concentrated flow occurs (Ministry of Transportation Ontario, 1997).
For sheet flow up to and including 130 m in length, Manning’s Kinematic Equation shall be used:

Where:
ts = Time of overland sheet flow (min)
n = Manning’s roughness coefficient from Design Chart 2.01 (Ministry of Transportation Ontario, 1997)
L = Length of overland flow path (m)
P2 = Rainfall depth associated with the 2-year, 24-hour rainfall depth (mm)
Sw = Watershed slope (m/m)
Beyond the initial maximum assumed length of sheet flow of 130 m, runoff shall be assumed to continue as shallow concentrated flow with velocity calculated by (Federal Highway Administration, 2009):

Where:
Vsc = Velocity of shallow concentrated flow (m/s)
k = Intercept coefficient from Table 3-3 of the FHWA HEC-22 Manual (Federal Highway Administration, 2009)
 Sw = Watershed slope (%)
The time of shall concentrated flow can be calculated by the following equation (Federal Highway Administration, 2009):

Where:
tsc = Time of shallow concentrated flow (minutes)
L = Length of shallow concentrated flow (m)
Vsc = Velocity of shallow concentrated flow (m/s)
The total time of concentration for a catchment with length of flow greater than 130 m shall be determined by the sum of the time of sheet flow from Manning’s Kinematic Equation and shallow concentrated flow (Federal Highway Administration, 2009).
8.6.4Storm Sewers
Manning’s equation shall be used to size storm sewers for the minor storm (Ministry of Transportation Ontario, 1997):

Where:
Q = Flow rate (m3/s)
n = Manning’s roughness coefficient (From MTO Design Chart 2.01)
A = Cross-sectional area (m2)
R = Hydraulic radius (m)
S = Slope (m/m)
For paved catchment areas, the time of concentration to any point in the associated storm sewer system shall be determined by the sum of the initial time of concentration to the inlet of the system and the time of flow within the system to the point under consideration. The time of flow within the system shall be calculated from the flow velocity and the travel length. The minimum initial time of concentration shall be 5 minutes for closely spaced inlets and 10 minutes for widely spaced inlets (Ministry of Transportation Ontario, 1997).
Storm sewer design parameters are summarized in Table 34 (Ministry of Transportation Ontario, 1997).

2.The minimum slope of sewer shall be based on the specified maximum velocity. Where velocities are greater than 3 m/s, additional design factors shall be taken to protect against pipe displacement, scouring, erosion, and hydraulic jumps. Supercritical flow should not occur.
8.6.5Manholes, Catch Basins, Ditch Inlets, and Headwalls
The spacing of catch basins and catch basin manholes shall be determined such that the maximum depth of water over catch basins and catch basin manholes during the major storm shall not be greater than 300 mm.
Suitable drops will be provided across manholes to compensate for the energy losses. When the pipe size does not change through a manhole and the upstream flow velocity does not exceed 1.5 m/s, the following allowances will be made to compensate for hydraulic losses. See Table 35 (Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks, 2008).

Tb,max = Maximum tractive bed stress (N/m2)
Kbd = Tractive force bend coefficient from Design Charts 2.26 and 2.27 (Ministry of Transportation Ontario, 1997).
The minimum freeboard allowance in open channels shall be the greater of 0.3 m or two (2) times the velocity head. The velocity head is given by (Ministry of Transportation Ontario, 1997):

Where:
V = Channel velocity (m/s)
g = Acceleration due to gravity (m/s2)
The freeboard shall be maintained while considering increased flow depths due to curves in channel alignments. The increase in water surface elevation at the outer bank (Δd/2) during subcritical flow is given by (Ministry of Transportation Ontario, 1997):

Where:
Δd/2 = Height of water surface above normal depth at the outer bank (m)
V = Average channel velocity (m/s)
T = Surface width of the channel (m)
g = Acceleration due to gravity (m/s2)
Rc = Radius to centerline of channel (m)
The maximum side slope for major channels shall be 3H:1V. For minor channels, 2H:1V maximum side slopes will be considered.
Channels shall be designed to accommodate subcritical flow. Where topography does not permit subcritical slopes, additional design factors shall be taken to protect against scouring, erosion, and uncontrolled hydraulic jumps (Ministry of Transportation Ontario, 1997).
Stormwater channels shall be lined to minimize erosion. Energy dissipaters shall be installed as required (Ministry of Transportation Ontario, 1997).
8.6.7Culverts
Culvert section shall be circular pipe, box, arch, or ellipse shaped.

8.6.8Quantity Control
Quantity control will be provided by controlling stormwater runoff from project areas, as required to satisfy allowable peak discharge rates. These allowable release rates vary throughout project areas dependent on the nature of the receiving systems. For example, where project drainage systems are discharging into existing City of Toronto municipal storm sewers the release rate will be calculated based on the lesser of pre-development 2-year peak flow rate or the capacity of existing sewers. Where connections are being made to natural watercourses, or existing culverts, target release rates will be to match equivalent pre-development peak flow rates. This will be assessed on a location-by-location basis.
If there are no outlets available for the major system, flow storage areas may be created to detain the water and allow it to flow back to the minor system once the flow subsides, thus reducing the risk of surface flooding. Excess flows will be conveyed via the guideway, streets, open channels and walkways to a City approved public outlet, in accordance with the City’s Sewer Guidelines.
8.6.9Quality Control
Quality control objectives will be satisfied through a variety of Stormwater Management (SWM) techniques within the right-of-way, including LID features and other Best Management Practices (BMPs) such as infiltration trenches, bioswales, and enhanced grassed swales, as well as end-of-pipe solutions such as ponds and oil-grit separator (OGS) devices where required. Design of these features will be undertaken in accordance with the appropriate MECP guidance documents, and the TRCA/CVC LID (Low Impact Development) Design Guide where applicable.
All drainage will be captured and managed within the ROW with stormwater management facilities that provide attenuation up to the 100-year storm with water quality protection that meets MECP’s “Enhanced” standard (80% TSS removal rate) before discharging to outlet locations. Outlet locations and specific SWM approaches will vary throughout the project location, as defined by constraints and opportunities in each catchment area.
8.6.10Erosion and Sediment Control
Stormwater control, mitigation, and Erosion and Sediment Control (ESC) measures will be implemented where appropriate for the urban context of the project to ensure deleterious substances and other pollutants do not leave the site and enter watercourses or the municipal drainage infrastructure.
Site-specific ESC Plans, as a component plan of the project-wide Erosion and Sediment Control Plan to comply with Schedule A-9 – Environmental Obligations environmental approvals and commitments and with applicable codes will be developed to address local potential environmentally sensitive site conditions, including watercourse crossings.
In addition to City and other Governmental Authority requirements, ESC Plans will be prepared in accordance with the following documents:
TRCA, 2019, Erosion and Sediment Control Guideline for Urban Construction.
Canadian Standards Association, 2019, National Standard of Canada: Erosion and Sediment Control Installation and Maintenance (WSA-W208-20)
Permits and approvals for all in-water works in accordance with all applicable Governmental Authorities’ requirements will be obtained.
All fisheries (timing) window restrictions imposed by applicable Governmental Authorities on activities on or adjacent to watercourses associated with the works will be adhered to.
1.1.1.Sanitary Sewage System

8.7Roadways Scope Delineation
The roadways scope covers all external public roads that are located outside of the property boundaries of the facility or station site. The Civil and Drainage discipline scope will cover roads inside the property line or access to a facility, or a similar structure. Also related are paths, parking lots, emergency access routes and roads within the property boundaries.
8.8Roadways Design Approach
In general, the design approach will include the following tasks:
1.Review all roadway and pedestrian engineering reference documents.
2.Review site specific design criteria or obtain from the traffic authority.
3.Develop site specific design criteria document.
4.Perform site visit.
5.Collection of all necessary inputs (topographic survey, legal survey, traffic analysis, geotechnical, hydrogeological, environmental, utilities).
6.Identify site or design constraints.
7.Develop design alignment and layout.
8.Develop model and design plans.
9.Develop construction and traffic staging plans.
10.Review design and staging with other affected CJV Engineering disciplines and CJV.
11.Review design and staging with traffic authority.
12.Develop quantity estimate.
13.Develop construction specifications.
8.9Roadways Design Criteria
The roadway design criteria as outlined in C6 will be based upon the specific design standards as follows:
Municipal Standards.
Reference Documents issued by MTO.
MTO Roadside Design Manual (2020).
TAC Geometric Design Guide for Canadian Roads.
AASHTO supplementary standards for road alignment and pavement design.
The design vehicle will be based upon provincial and municipal requirements for intersection geometry, sight distances and horizontal and vertical clearances taking into consideration adjacent truck and bus routes as well as emergency services and maintenance vehicles. Detours and access will be designed to accommodate vehicles requiring access to the site.
Lane configurations will be designed to match existing conditions with turning radius to accommodate the applicable design vehicle while minimizing to reduce pedestrian crossing distances.
Roadway pavement structures will be designed in accordance with applicable municipal standards or in the absence of OPSS requirements and site geotechnical conditions.
8.10Station Specific Roadway Design Criteria
8.10.1Port Credit GO Station TBC
No specific design criteria required for public roadways at this station because no roadway scope identified.
8.10.2Etobicoke GO Station
This station is to be demolished to accommodate a new main line track. The demolition work includes pedestrian access to the site, so the roadway scope is limited to refinishing the affected surfaces at the property line in accordance with municipal requirements.
8.10.3East Gwillimbury GO Station
No specific design criteria required for public roadways at this station because there is no specific roadway scope included, however, emergency egress/access to the Nokiidaa bike trail to the east of the station could be considered.
8.10.4York University GO Station
This station is to be demolished. The demolition work includes pedestrian access to the site, so the roadway scope is limited to refinishing the affected surfaces at the property line in accordance with municipal requirements.
8.10.5Caledonia GO Station
A new pedestrian walkway is required to provide direct Barrier-Free access from the sidewalk of Bowie Avenue and Beltline Trail to the north end of the new side platform east of the track. The pedestrian walkway connection to Bowie Avenue and Beltline Trail will be designed in accordance with municipal standards.
8.10.6Stouffville GO Station TBC
No specific design criteria required for public roadways at this station as there is no roadway scope identified.
8.10.7Kennedy GO Station
No specific design criteria required for public roadways at this station as there is no roadway scope identified.
8.10.8Danforth GO Station
No specific design criteria required for public roadways at this station as there is no roadway scope identified.
8.10.9Scarborough GO Station
The site is accessed by Reeve Avenue to the east. There was no specific design criteria for Revee Avenue so it is expected that the internal roads at the Reeve Avenue access and any reconstruction required on Reeve Avenue will match the existing geometry and cross section of Reeve Avenue.
8.10.10Durham College Oshawa GO Station
The scope of roadway work at this station is specifically focused on bus access and pedestrian crossing of the Bus Loop.
The Bus Loop will likely need to shift slightly north toward Bloor Street West. Once the new platform and track locations and clearances to the south of the Bus Loop are fixed, the Bus Loop can be re-designed. The Bus Loop should remain within the existing footprint to the degree possible but may impact some of the parking to the north.
There are no specific design criteria provided for this roadway scope except any existing bus stop and pedestrian crossing standards that may exist for the local municipality.
It is expected that the design will be tailored to re-establish the existing features. This includes several bus stop bays along the perimeter of the Bus Loop. Along tangent portions of the Bus Loop, buses can park at a stop location and exit by pulling through without the need to reverse. The Bus Loop’s road surface adjacent to the stop locations will need to be sufficiently wide to accommodate adjacent through bus traffic. A painted median separating the two directions of traffic within the Bus Loop will be included. The functionality of the Bus Loop and bus bays will be confirmed through an AutoTURN analysis. The design vehicle will be determined in conjunction with the local municipality. The entire loop will be raised curb drainage around the perimeter of the Bus Loop with adjacent pedestrian walkway.
The adjacent pedestrian walkways will be sufficiently wide to accommodate expected pedestrian traffic between the Bus Loop, parking area and transit platforms while still accommodating all relocated roadside furniture including illumination, bus shelters, generator equipment and Presto equipment. The width of this Bus Loop walkway will be established in conjunction with the local municipality.
A pedestrian crossing of the bus access road will be required between the site parking area and the new platform planned in the southwest part of the site. This pedestrian crossing will meet municipal standards for accessibility, width, and signalization.
8.11Traffic Management Design Criteria
For each station renovation, a qualitative review of site access and immediate adjacent vehicle and pedestrian infrastructure will be completed. This assessment will determine the need for additional quantitative studies. Stations that are identified to have infrastructure of concern will have quantitative reviews completed to identify if additional infrastructure upgrades are required on site or off site. This could include signal timing changes, pedestrian or vehicle crossing upgrades, or geometric changes.
The requirements for Traffic Management at each site will follow municipal and regional guidelines as required based on construction activities. Traffic management will focus on safe access to the site for all modes of transportation including pedestrians, cyclists, transit and vehicles. Depending on the extent of construction activities, a Transportation Impact Study (TIS) will be developed in accordance with the requirements in C6, which states a minimum the TIS shall:
Assess the effect of the major stages of construction on operations of the municipal transportation network.
Enable the development of appropriate transit management plans to mitigate impacts on transportation mobility around a Construction Activity and Site.
Enable the development of appropriate traffic control plans to mitigate impacts on transportation mobility around a Construction Activity and Site.
The findings of the TIS will be used to inform the development of the Initial Works Traffic Management Plan, Transit Management Plan and Traffic Control Plan (IWTM). Each IWTM shall include traffic control plans for each site and to be coordinated with CJV regarding required lane closure and traffic management. All Traffic Control Plans will be developed in accordance with Ontario Traffic Manual Book 7.
8.11.1Traffic Modelling
Where required to support the development of a TIS, traffic modelling utilizing Synchro 11 software (Synchro) will be performed. Synchro implements analysis methodologies defined in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) for measuring intersection performance including capacity, intersection delays (in seconds per vehicle), and queue lengths.
Capacity is assessed based on intersection geometry and control. The volume-to-capacity ratio measures the level of congestion or intersection utilization by dividing the traffic demand volume by the available capacity of a roadway or an intersection. A volume-to-capacity ratio greater than one (1) indicates that a lane group, approach, or the overall intersection is operating at effective capacity and that congestion is present.
Level of Service (LOS) is a qualitative measure used to relate the quality of traffic flow on roadways. For intersections, it is based on the average stopped delay per vehicles, in seconds. There are six (6) levels of LOS defined with LOS A representing the best possible operating conditions and LOS F, the worst where there is congestion and queues will fail to clear. The LOS criteria as defined in the HCM are summarized in Table 40.

9.Track Design Criteria
This section provides a summary of design criteria, considerations and assumptions used in the design of trackwork and associated civil infrastructure. The trackwork geometric design criteria establishes the basic Civil Engineering Criteria for horizontal and vertical control, alignment, and clearances for train/vehicle dimensions. This trackwork geometric design criteria is developed for all sub-divisions of the ONxpress project, accounting for passenger safety, comfort, alignment design as per AREMA Standard and the CI Standards Public Home Page (gosite.ca). It has been developed for all accepted engineering practices currently in use on operating rapid transit and railroad systems.
For the detailed design of track infrastructure, refer to BoD entitled, “Corridors Trackwork and Track Alignment Design Criteria” document (ONC-ECW-5090-SWS-PWS-EGM-DCR-00004). It summarizes of the design requirements, considerations, and assumptions to be applied to the design of track on the heavy rail MX corridors.
9.1Track Scope Delineation
Refer to the BoD entitled, “Corridors Trackwork and Track Alignment Design Criteria” (ONC-ECW-5090-SWS-PWS-EGM-DCR-00004) for more information on track scope delineation. The scope of work covered by this document is from the top of the sub-grade up to the top of the rail for ballasted track, and from the top of the concrete slab surface up to the top of the rail for direct fixation track, including any second pour concrete where required and special trackwork.
The Track and Alignment scope is closely tied and interfaces directly with the structural and civil engineering disciplines, as shown in Figure 20.

Figure 20: Section View Drawing Displaying Track Scope Delineation
The Line Stations team’s scope of work will include designing all elements required for existing station renovations such as external building walls and platforms. The design scope extends 1 m away from each element into the adjacent discipline scope of work.
9.2Track Alignment Design Criteria
The preliminary track alignment design criteria will be based on the current AREMA Standards and MX Standards and Regulations.
The design of the alignment shall be conducted to optimize the following requirements:
Maximum speed through all corridor alignments of 100 mph (162 km/h).
Maximum acceptable passenger comfort.
Minimum reconstruction and/or construction cost and maintenance.
The dynamic and static envelope clearances are shown in the GO DRM and GO Track standards and will be referred to for track design through the station areas and new platform designs and modifications. Figure 21 shows a portion of the GO Track standard drawing, entitled Track Clearance Design Guideline (Plan No.: GTS-3004, Rev.00 and dated Aug. 31, 2018).

Figure 21: Track Clearance Diagram for Tangent and Curved Track
Minimum tangent lengths between curves shall be designed and/or recommended to ensure sufficient time for passengers to recover from one curve before entering another.
Superelevation on curves to be applied to minimize lateral accelerations felt by passengers and to prevent passengers from feeling as if they are sliding across the seat.
Minimum vertical curve radii to be designed with passenger comfort in mind.
9.3Railway Drainage Design Criteria
A new track drainage system shall be provided where the Initial Works include modification of the sub-ballast and sub grade level. This shall also be provided if any existing track structure drainage system is degraded for the purpose of meeting track design requirements.
9.4Construction Materials
Except in special trackwork areas, ballasted track will be designed for the use of concrete tie and ballast. Construction materials which are related to trackwork construction include, but are not limited to: steel, timber, concrete, crushed stone for track ballast and other special track components. They are utilized to construct the rails, turnouts, fasteners, railroads ties, switches, ballast and subgrade. For more detailed information regarding track alignment, railway drainage and construction materials, refer to BoD - Corridors Trackwork and Track Alignment Design Criteria document (ONC-ECW-5090-SWS-PWS-EGM-DCR-00004).
10.Cable Containment Design Criteria
This section provides a summary of design criteria, considerations and assumptions used in the design of the interface between corridor cable containment and buildings and facilities. Refer to the “Corridor Cable Containment Design Criteria” BoD document (ONC-ECW-5090-SWS-PWS-EGM-DCR-00002).
10.1Cable Containment Scope Delineation
The Cable Containment scope delineation can be explained in the diagram in Figure 22.

Figure 22: Plan View Drawing showing Cable Containment Scope Delineation
10.2Cable Containment Station Interface Design Criteria
10.2.1Approach
The preferred approach to cable containment around line stations is to install mainline cable containment clear of any buildings, where the right-of-way permits.
If not possible, routing mainline cable containment under the station platform will have to be considered. Coordination with the structural team will be required in such cases.
Paths to the station electrical or communications rooms branching from the mainline cable containment are also required.
Any existing spare conduits entering the buildings will be used first to provide these required paths. Where no spare conduits are available or when the number of conduits required exceed the number of available spares, a new interface to enter the building will be required.
Depending on site properties, this interface point can be located: at a manhole or pullbox outside the building, underground at the foundation walls whenever there are rooms below ground, or through the station wall. The interface point for each line station will have to be defined in coordination with the following disciplines.
10.2.2Structural
For mainline raceways under station platforms, the Capital Projects Group Rail Corridor Raceway Requirements (MX-ELEC-RCWY) prescribes an installation.
Such an installation requires coordination with the structural team to ensure the platform integrity is maintained and that room is available.
Whenever duct banks are entering through a foundation, sleeves or a rebar free rectangular opening can be used, depending on the approach selected by the structural team. The conduits will be sloped away from the building preventing water ingress but waterproofing at the conduits / foundation wall interface is another important aspect of design to consider. The solution to achieve this may also vary based on site conditions.
10.2.3Architectural
If conduits need to enter a building above-ground, coordination will take place with the architectural team to ensure the technical cable containment solution can be harmonized with the building architectural characteristics and to ensure adequate waterproofing at the wall interface.
10.2.4Electrical
Coordination will take place with the station electrical team to determine the availability of any existing or projected conduits or duct banks at the station (inside the building or under the platform), leading from the corridor to electrical or communication rooms.
The number of required conduits will be calculated by the cable containment team based on E&M projected cable lists and requirements. The station electrical team will be responsible to provide equivalent cable containment inside the building, from the interface point to the required technical room(s).
10.3Cable Containment Detailed Design
For the detailed design of cable containment infrastructure, refer to the BoD entitled, “Corridor Cable Containment Design Criteria” (ONC-ECW-5090-SWS-PWS-EGM-DCR-00002).
11.Environmental Design Criteria
For detailed information related to environmental work throughout each corridor, refer to the Environmental BoD (Document No. ONC-ECW-5090-SWS-ENV-DES-DCR-00001). This will include a summary of environmental design criteria, considerations and assumptions used in the design of buildings and facilities applicable to the entirety of the GO Rail Expansion - On-Corridor Program (OnCorr).

The cultural heritage discipline is closely related to both the environmental and architectural disciplines. The aim of cultural heritage designations is to protect cultural heritage from the adverse impacts of project activities and support its preservation. It is also to promote the equitable sharing of benefits from the use of cultural heritage in business activities.
Line Stations that do not have any official heritage designations will be evaluated individually to identify whether they have any heritage value or contain any elements of heritage value that contribute to their heritage significance. Depending on the age of these stations (40 years and more), this would require the preparation of a Cultural Heritage Evaluation Report (CHER) to highlight the potential character-defining elements that need to be preserved.
Within the context of Stouffville, Danforth, Oshawa, Burlington and Toronto Pearson Airport Go Stations, the initial evaluation of the existence of heritage status, significance or potential significance revealed that these stations and their platforms are relatively new and do not have any heritage significance. Nevertheless, the building of Stouffville Station was identified as containing heritage elements. Accordingly, the Station building might be the subject of a CHER; the requirement for CHER will be confirmed by a designated heritage expert following an in-person visit to the Station. Further investigations to identify “Adjacent Heritage Properties” within 25 m of Danforth, Oshawa, Toronto Pearson Airport, and the rest of the GO line stations in OnCorr scope need to be carried out.
11.3Cultural Heritage Design Criteria
Cultural heritage is seen as a common good of great importance. It is also a pre-requisite for building social cohesion and developing individual and group identity, according to UNESCO.
As per the PA (Schedule A-9), a Cultural Heritage Risk Management Plan (CHRMP) shall be prepared for all directly and indirectly impacted properties of heritage significance or potential heritage significance. This CHRMP is a framework that includes the evaluation of the impact of all planned interventions on the properties (architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, lighting, etc.), as well as other types of assessments related to the provision of any of the following:
Cultural heritage evaluation reports CHER.
Cultural heritage assessment report CHAR.
Cultural heritage reports CHR.
Heritage impact assessments HIA.
Conservation plans CP.
Moreover, a Strategic Conservation Plan (SCP) shall be prepared for all Provincial properties. For provincial Designated Line Stations, the SCP will include all heritage elements that are subjects to change by the planned work. this might include the station buildings, platforms, vertical circulations, canopies, signage, lighting fixtures and all other heritage elements. In the absence of SCP, a Heritage Impact Assessment report (HIA) shall be prepared for every intervention impacting the heritage character of the property. HIA, would eventually require the approval of Parks Canada. The SCP will highlight the design requirements relevant to each Line Station.
