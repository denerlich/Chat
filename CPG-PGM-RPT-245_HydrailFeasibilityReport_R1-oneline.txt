Executive Summary

Metrolinx’s Regional Express Rail Program (RER) is the largest transit infrastructure program in
Canadian history that transcends borders and fosters connections between communities across the
Greater Golden Horseshoe. Electrifying Metrolinx-owned segments of the GO Transit (GO) network is
an important part of delivering on a promise to bring faster and more frequent services across the
region; Metrolinx is on track to electrify and expand the rail network, and deliver more two-way,
all-day services by increasing the number of weekly trips from about 1,500 to nearly 6,000 by 2025.
In June 2017, the Minister of Transportation of Ontario announced that Metrolinx would study the
feasibility of using hydrogen fuel cells (HFCs) to electrify the GO network as an alternative to
electrification using conventional overhead wires. Recent advances in the use of HFCs to power
electric trains in other jurisdictions make it important for Ontario to consider this technology as it has
the potential to deliver the planned RER service benefits with reduced cost and time risks.
This report investigates the feasibility of operating the GO network using HFC-powered rail vehicles –
also known as a Hydrail System – based on an expected service model for the GO network that will
start in 2025. It considers both the train service pattern and rail vehicle fleet mix to analyze the
technical and financial requirements for operating the Hydrail System.
The study concludes that it should be technically feasible to build and operate a Hydrail System for
the GO network, and the system’s overall lifetime costs are equivalent to the alternative of a
conventional overhead electrification system.
It is also acknowledged that such a system is complex, and at this scale, would be a world first. This
means that significant challenges would need to be successfully managed to achieve the objective of
starting electrified services on the GO network by 2025.
Two of the most significant of these challenges are:


Fleet implementation – Designing and building a fleet of HFC rail vehicles for RER services would
carry a risk of delay due to the design challenges of integrating the fuel cell system into the rail
vehicle platform and the production challenges of building a full fleet of new vehicles.



Electricity price – Due to the large amount of electricity that will be needed for hydrogen
production (1% of average daily generated supply in Ontario) by the Hydrail System, the
economic viability of Hydrail will depend on how the electricity price variability risk is apportioned
with the private sector. There may need to be a provincial government commitment on this within
the RER procurement process.

However, there are also many significant risks in taking forward the conventional overhead
electrification system that could also impact the 2025 milestone. One key differentiatior between the
two options is that the Hydrail System also creates the opportunity for broader benefits to Ontario in
terms of economic development in the technology sector and as a catalyst for the adoption of
hydrogen in other areas of society.

Hydrail System Structure

The structure of the Hydrail System is shown on Figure 1-1.
FIGURE 1-1 HYDRAIL SYSTEM STRUCTURE

The feasibility study is based on the train service pattern and rail vehicle fleet mix (locomotives and
electric multiple units [EMUs]) that Metrolinx intends to operate on the electrified GO network from
2025 on the completion of the RER program of infrastructure enhancements.
A simulation model of the operation of the Hydrail System, based on this pattern and fleet, was used
to calculate the size of the fuel cell system on the rail vehicles, the size of the electrolyzers needed to
produce the hydrogen, and the amount of electricity needed from the grid. These sizing calculations
were then used to forecast the capital cost to implement the Hydrail System and its annual operation
and maintenance (O&M) costs.

Hydrail System Design and Operation

The key factor in determining the feasibility of the Hydrail System is whether it can provide the
expected GO functional and operating performance that the RER program needs to deliver.
The feasibility study concludes that there is a good level of confidence that this can be achieved
based on the assessment of the following:


The functionality and size of the end-to-end Hydrail System



The amount of electricity the system will need to consume to produce the required volume of
hydrogen, and the ability of the system to use electricity when the hourly electricity prices are at
their lowest



The design of the fuel cell systems to be integrated into the rail vehicles to deliver the
performance needed for RER services



The modularity of the components of the system, which creates a high level of performance
redundancy



The operation of HFC-powered locomotives using an arrangement of 1 locomotive with 6
carriages, which can then be joined so that 2 locomotives pulls 12 carriages



The expected ability to refuel the HFC-powered locomotives and EMUs in time frames
comparable to current diesel locomotive refuelling



The existing commercial availability and technological performance of all components that will
be needed for the Hydrail System



The interest of the major global rail vehicle manufacturers in building HFC-powered rail vehicles
and the pending introduction of these vehicles into revenue service on other networks



The lessons learned from the Hydrail Symposium held in Toronto which are consistent with, and
supportive of, the findings and recommendations in the feasibility study

In addition, there are specific benefits that Metrolinx would experience if the Hydrail System is
implemented, instead of electrifying the GO network through the conventional overhead catenary
system, including:


Capital cost saving – The avoidance of the capital costs of the infrastructure works in the rail
corridor to install the overhead catenary system, lower the track in places, raise bridges, and
divert utilities (even though the Hydrail System has its own infrastructure works, these are
smaller in scale and will generally not interface with the live railway; this delivers a saving in the
initial investment that will need to be made in RER)



Environment – There would be fewer lineside trees required to be removed for Hydrail

However, the conventional overhead catenary system has benefits over the Hydrail System in the
following areas:


There is no requirement for refuelling – this will have a comparative benefit in terms of
operating flexibility and cost



Rail vehicle capital cost will be lower due to the HFC system equipment that will be integrated
into the HFC-powered rail vehicles



The cost of equipment renewals will be lower, as the cycle of refurbishment is longer for
conventional overhead catenary system equipment

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

The study of the Hydrail System resulted in several key design and operational conclusions, as follows:
1. The Hydrail System needs to be designed and operated as a complete end to end system. At one
end of the system are rail vehicles operating on the GO network. At the other end of the system,
power is drawn from the grid needed to produce hydrogen. The hydrogen then moves through
the system via storage tanks, distribution infrastructure, and dispensing facilities until it is stored in
tanks on the rail vehicle.
There are two main options for where the hydrogen could be produced. The first option would
use a few large facilities located away from the rail network; in this case, the hydrogen would need
to be transported to the refuelling locations by truck or pipeline. The alternative is to locate the
hydrogen production facilities near the refuelling facilities. This is the most economically
advantageous solution, and is the one that is recommended in the study.
2. One of the key advantages of the Hydrail System compared with conventional electrification is that
it can choose when to draw electricity from the grid. This means that it can take advantage of the
low prices of electricity that generally occur during the night in Ontario. By maintaining a surplus
of hydrogen in storage over what is needed every day, and choosing only to produce hydrogen
when the price of electricity is less than a certain value, it is possible to minimize the cost of Hydrail
System operations. The overhead catenary system does not have this level of flexibility, as it needs
to draw electricity from the grid when required to operate the train, regardless of the price.
3. The HFC-powered locomotive and the HFC-powered EMU will both use an HFC system. This
consists of a combination of fuel cell, battery, ultracapacitor, and regenerative braking (as shown
in Figure 1-1). The way this system will operate is that the battery and ultracapacitor are sized to
provide the power needed for the train to accelerate to its cruising speed between stations. The
fuel cell is then used to charge the batteries as the train is cruising. Then, as the train is braking for
the next station, the regenerative braking system further charges the batteries and the
ultracapacitor.
The simulation modelling work that has been undertaken as part of the feasibility study
demonstrates that HFC-powered locomotives and EMUs can be designed to deliver the required
RER services.
The benefit of the regenerative braking system is that it recovers energy from the traction motors
that are part of the vehicle’s braking system, and this energy can then also be used to charge the
batteries and utltracapacitors. Modern electric rail vehicles all have regenerative braking systems;
however, these are not generally sized to maximize the amount of energy that could be recovered.
With the Hydrail System, there will be an opportunity to consider how the onboard power
management systems are designed so that they maximize the amount of energy recovered during
braking. This could further reduce the size of the fuel cell needed and reduce the volume of
hydrogen consumed each trip.
The ability to integrate this equipment into a locomotive platform has been validated by three rail
vehicle manufacturers as part of the initial work undertaken by the HFC Locomotive Project that is
also part of the Metrolinx Hydrail Workstream (an overview of this project and the Hydrail
Workstream is provided in the Introduction section of this report).
4. The components in the Hydrail System’s subsystems are of a modular design (that is, multiple,
small tanks; fuel cells; and batteries). This means that failure, or reduced performance, of one
component should not have a significant impact on subsystem operation.

Revision B

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

For example, on the rail vehicles, the fuel cells will be arranged in parallel stacks so that a failure,
or reduced performance, of one unit will only result in the fuel cell system’s reduced output power.
Even if the entire fuel cell subsystem does become unavailable, there should be sufficient power in
the battery system to enable the rail vehicle to operate in a degraded mode so that it can reach a
place of safety. The battery subsystem would also be designed so that a failure in one battery unit
should only lead to a reduction in peak power available to accelerate the train.
5. While RER train services using conventional overhead electrification are intended to be operated
using an electric locomotive pulling 12 unpowered carriages, the Hydrail feasibility study
recommends that 2 smaller HFC locomotives are used instead of one. This is because the volume
of hydrogen needed on a single locomotive would not be sufficient to meet the service range
requirements that Metrolinx needs between refuelling cycles.
The additional benefit of using 2 locomotives with 12 carriages is that Metrolinx will have the
option of splitting the consist into 2 consists of 6 carriages and 1 locomotive for out-of-peak hours
when fewer passengers are travelling. This will reduce the operating costs of the rail network.
The concept of one locomotive with six carriages could also be used as an alternative to the
current plan to use EMUs for RER peak and off-peak services, and should be considered further.
The benefits of this would be:


The locomotives will be compliant with Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) standards
(whereas, the EMUs are compliant with International Union of Railways [UIC] standards, which
would be new to Canada).



Metrolinx will be able to continue to operate its existing fleet of bi-level carriages.

6. A key determinant of the operational efficiency of the GO network using the Hydrail System will be
the length of time that it takes to refuel a rail vehicle with hydrogen. The refuelling duration needs
to be minimized whether the refuelling takes place during nonoperational hours at the end of the
day, or during a break between trips in the daily service timetable.
Hydrogen refuelling facilities designed for use by cars and buses typically only need to transfer
low volumes of hydrogen. A facility needed to transfer the volumes required for the Hydrail
System has yet to be built. However, an integrated design between the storage on the rail vehicle
and the refuelling facility will be based on using multiple tanks on the rail vehicle that can be filled
simultaneously using a manifold system. The target refuelling time of about 30 minutes is
expected to be feasible through engineering design.
However, the need to refuel the HFC-powered rail vehicles is a disadvantage when compared to
electric rail vehicles that use the conventional overhead catenary system. This means that these
electric rail vehicles have benefits in terms of rail service operational planning because refuelling
does not need to be factored into the daily railway operating plans.
7. The technology on which the Hydrail System is based might seem like it is cutting edge and
innovative, with inherent risks relating to reliability, safety, and performance. However, all
components of the Hydrail System are based on technology that is fully developed, commercially
available, and already in use in industrial applications throughout the globe, many of them in
extremely harsh environments. This means that we are confident we will achieve a high level of
reliability from these components in a heavy railway environment.
The challenge in developing the HFC-powered rail vehicles is not so much in the performance of
the individual components of the system, but in the integration of these components into a hybrid
CPG-PGM-RPT-245

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

fuel cell system and then into the rail vehicle platform. This challenge is not to be underestimated,
as the space available on the rail vehicle is limited, and there are many design constraints that will
need to be overcome, particularly weight distribution.
However, large rail vehicle manufacturers are highly experienced in systems engineering, and
have the tools and knowledge needed to successfully undertake this integration design.
8. Further, the major rail vehicle manufacturers are showing a high level of interest in HFC-powered
trains. For example:
a. Over the course of 2017, Alstom has been testing its Coradia iLint train, which is an HFCpowered EMU, in Germany. Alstom recently announced that it had received an order for 14 of
these trains which are due to go into revenue service in 2021.
It is interesting to note that the vendor who is supplying the fuel cells to Alstom for this train is
Hydrogenics, based in Mississauga.
b. CRRC, the main Chinese rail vehicle manufacturer, has recently announced that it has
introduced into revenue service a HFC-powered light rail vehicle (LRV) in the city of Foshan
and is planning to expand this concept to other cities that have LRV projects in development.
It is also interesting to note that the vendor supplying the fuel cells to CRRC is Ballard Power
Systems (Ballard), based in Vancouver.
c. Siemens has also recently announced that it has entered into a partnership with Ballard for the
development of an HFC-powered train.
In addition, other rail vehicle manufacturers have expressed an interest to Metrolinx in
participating in the HFC Locomotive Project, which would lead to the construction of a prototype
HFC-powered locomotive.
However, in assessing the cost of procuring a fleet of HFC-powered rail vehicles there will be a
premium for these vehicles in comparison to those required for a conventional overhead catenary
system. This will be due to:
a. The manufacturer’s design costs for such vehicles being higher as there is a development
element of the work that will need to be undertaken
b. The cost of the hybrid HFC equipment that will need to be integrated into the vehicles will be
more expensive than the electrical equipment that is integrated into a conventional electric rail
vehicle
9. Installing the infrastructure required for the overhead catenary system requires a significant
amount of construction work to take place in, or near to, the rail corridor. This work includes:
a. Erection of overhead line gantries and catenary wires
b. Construction of new substations
c. Diversion of utilities
d. Lowering of the track bed in some locations, and rebuilding some bridges (to obtain the
required height clearance)
e. Modifying other bridges to erect safety walls

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

Implementing the Hydrail System would mean that this work and the associated capital costs
would be avoided.
The Hydrail System itself would require fixed infrastructure assets to be built in relation to:
a. Hydrogen production facilities
b. Transportation infrastructure
c. Storage facilities
d. Refuelling facilities
On balance, it is expected that there will be a significant cost saving in the initial capital cost of the
fixed infrastructure of the Hydrail System in comparison to that required for the conventional
overhead catenary system.
10. The Hydrail System has environmental benefits over the overhead catenary system, particularly in
reducing the total number of trees that need to be cleared along the rail corridors.

Financial Modelling

An assessment has been made of the Net Present Value (NPV) cost of implementing and operating
the Hydrail System. Using a sensitivity analysis approach, a low-cost scenario was created that has a
benefit to cost ratio (BCR) of 3.01, and a high-cost scenario was created that has a BCR of 2.65.
This compares to a BCR of 3.07 for the existing RER business case based on conventional
electrification.
These results should be qualified because they could be affected by risks and opportunities that
need to be further investigated, including the following:


Cost saving of avoiding the construction of the overhead catenary system



Forecast difference between the prices of night-time (off-peak price) electricity and day-time
(peak price) electricity



Forecast price of fuel cells



Overhaul cycle duration of fuel cells



Potential ability to share infrastructure costs with other users



Potential ability to commence RER services earlier than planned

Based on the level of design and cost analysis that it has been possible to undertake during the
feasibility study, the Hydrail System and the conventional overhead catenary system have equivalent
BCRs.
As mentioned in the previous section, the Hydrail System modelling has forecast both the system’s
capital and operating costs. These costs were then incorporated into a modified version of the RER
business case model to determine the system’s likely BCR. This has enabled the Hydrail System to be
compared to the conventionally electrified network from a financial perspective.
At this point in the assessment of the costs of the Hydrail System there are many assumptions that
have been made about the performance of the system and the likely costs of the system’s
components. To account for this uncertainty a sensitivity analysis has been run on many of the model’s
input variables. This has created a low-cost scenario, where optimistic values were set for the
variables, and a high-cost scenario, where pessimistic values were set for the variables.
The outputs of this modelling work show that:


The low-cost scenario has a BCR of 3.01



The high-cost scenario has a BCR of 2.65

This compares to a BCR of 3.07 for the existing RER business case based on conventional
electrification. These results need to be qualified as follows:

The implementation and operation costs for RER with conventional electrification are currently
being reviewed based on a more up-to-date definition of the project’s scope and prices. This will
enable the BCR to be updated and a forecast range between high and low probabilities to be
determined.



The actual costs for Hydrail could be influenced by the factors identified in the following
“Challenges” and “Opportunities” sections. There are four significant areas:
1. The price of electricity – the forecast prices of electricity between 2024 and 2035 have been
provided to us by the Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) and are based on the
2017 Long Term Energy Plan for Ontario.
Over the long-term the electricity prices for the Hydrail System will depend on the extent to
which:


The current surplus of generating capacity changes



Other users of off-peak electricity enter the market

These factors could influence the price of off-peak electricity in a positive or negative direction
from the current forecast which in turn would affect the comparative difference in the
operating costs of the Hydrail System and conventional electrification.
In the context of an RER procurement process with the Hydrail System as an option, it is
recommended that certainty is provided to bidders around the long-term pricing of off-peak
electricity. This will require consideration by the provincial government.
2. The price of fuel cells – the price range of fuel cells that has been included in the financial
modelling is a result of advice from industry sources. These views are based on current
volumes of production which are relatively low compared to the production volumes of other
technology items.
Over the medium-term the price of fuel cells could reduce further if hydrogen becomes a
major factor in global strategies for decarbonization.
3. The duration between overhauls for the fuel cells – based on industry sources we have
forecast that this duration would be about 9 years for the operation of fuel cells in the Hydrail
System. However, there is a significant amount of research being undertaken on fuel cell
technology and the possibility of a further improvement in this area should not be discounted.
This would also reduce the Hydrail System’s operating costs.
4. Sharing of infrastructure implementation and operating costs – as described in the
“Opportunities” section it would be feasible to share the costs of setting-up and operating the
hydrogen production facilities with other government and private sector users if the
appropriate incentives are put in place. This could lead to an improvement in the BCR for the
Hydrail System.


The NPV of the benefits resulting from operating the Hydrail System could be improved over the
current RER business case. This could be due to:


The earlier transition to RER services that could be achieved with the Hydrail System



The broader socio-economic benefits that implementing the Hydrail System might generate



The associated commercial opportunities that the Hydrail System might enable.

Based on these qualifications, the conclusion of the financial modelling is that, at this stage, there is
good equivalence between the Hydrail System and conventional electrification and that further
analysis needs to be undertaken on both.

Challenges

Hydrail is a complex system and there are likely to be many significant implementation challenges.
The feasibility study report has assessed the key risks that could affect the program’s design and
implementation as well as the operation of the Hydrail System.
The most significant risks are:


Delays in the timescales for the development, build, and introduction into service of HFCpowered rail vehicles



Unexpected operational reliability issues with the HFC-powered rail vehicles after they enter
revenue service



Concerns from the public and Metrolinx passengers to the concept of HFC-powered rail
vehicles



Delays in achieving approval from the safety regulators to the commencement of revenue
services with HFC-powered rail vehicles

If any of these risks occurs there could be a delay in the start of RER services. It is therefore
recommended that these and the other risks identified need to be further investigated and
mitigation plans for them implemented as part of the next stage of the Hydrail Program.

Implementing a Hydrail System on the GO network will require major challenges to be overcome.
These include:


The potential for the longer-than-planned development timescales for HFC-powered rail vehicles
so that Metrolinx is unable to meet the target of 2025 for the commencement of RER services.
Metrolinx has already started mitigate this risk through the process of developing both an
HFC-powered locomotive and EMU. By commissioning rail vehicle manufacturers to prepare
conceptual designs for both types of vehicles Metrolinx will be able to validate the principles of
how an HFC-powered rail vehicle will perform.
Beyond this concept design work, the risks of time over-runs during design, build, and testing of
rail vehicles would be managed by an appointed rail vehicle manufacturer. Based on the
experience of Alstom, which took 3 years to develop and bring into testing their Coradia iLint
HFC-powered EMU, it seems feasible to expect a rail vehicle manufacture to complete the
development and build of HFC-powered trains in the time available to commence RER services in
2025.
Furthermore, Metrolinx would expect to procure an HFC-powered rail vehicle fleet on the basis
that the supplier will be responsible for any risks to achieving the specified RER reliability and
availability targets.



HFC locomotives and EMUs of the type needed for RER do not yet exist; therefore, real-world
experience relating to reliability is limited to the operation of light rail vehicles and buses.
This means that even though the vehicles will go through an extensive development and testing
process, there is still a risk that when they enter revenue service, they will experience unexpected
issues with reliability that cause in-service failures and consequential impacts to customers.

This risk also applies to the hydrogen production, storage, refuelling, and dispensing facilities;
and it is probable that the greatest risk relates to the integration of these systems. However, this
risk can be mitigated by implementing and operating a small-scale prototype of the end-to-end
system so that lessons can be learned about the system’s operation, performance, and reliability;
and so these lessons can be fed back into the design, build, and operation of the full system.


Difficulties in gaining the public’s and Metrolinx passengers’ acceptance of the concept of the
Hydrail System.
There are many myths and misunderstandings about the safety of hydrogen, which, if not
addressed, could lead to resistance to the implementation of a Hydrail System. These would need
to be addressed through a comprehensive public communication strategy that provides a
considered perspective on safety and the resulting environmental benefits of using hydrogen.
The experience of the German government’s public communications strategy in relation to
hydrogen indicates that if a similar approach is adopted by Metrolinx, the likelihood that this could
become a major challenge would be reduced.



Achieving the approval of relevant safety regulators, including Transport Canada and TSSA,
would be a key objective of developing the Hydrail System and bringing it into service.
This challenge should not pose a significant risk as codes and standards already exist for all the
components that will be used in the Hydrail System. An important consideration for Hydrail is in
the regulations that would govern the overall safety management of the Hydrail vehicles in
scenarios where there has been an accident or a component failure.It is expected that the safety
risk in this situation would be acceptable because of several factors:


Safety in design would be a key objective during the Hydrail System design phase



Metrolinx will assemble a team of world leading experts in all aspects of hydrogen and railway
safety to provide it, and the rail vehicle manufacturer, with necessary advice on design safety
and regulation development.



Metrolinx will work closely with Transport Canada and TSSA through the design, build, and
testing process to understand what rules and regulations need to be developed specifically to
cover the Hydrail System.

Opportunities

The technical and operational evaluation of the Hydrail System has focussed on understanding how
it could be implemented and operated as a standalone system. However, the Hydrail System can
also be considered as part of the broader RER Program; as part of the overall public transportation
network; and as part of the Ontario economy.
As such, there are opportunities that could be developed during the implementation of the Hydrail
System that might deliver further benefits to both Metrolinx and the Province, including being able
to:


Commence some RER services earlier than the 2025 target date for RER



Operate RER services over the entire GO network; thereby, increasing the benefits of RER

Potential opportunities to the province are:


Being able to share the Hydrail System infrastructure capital with other users of hydrogen in the
Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA)



Being a catalyst for the expansion of businesses with a hydrogen technology focus and the
associated highly-skilled jobs

Taking forward the development of those opportunities beyond Metrolinx’s transportation mandate
will require consideration and guidance from the provincial government.
Taking the Hydrail System forward as the means of electrifying the GO network provides several
opportunities to create benefits that would not be available through an overhead catenary system
network, including:


The ability to incrementally introduce the HFC-powered rail vehicles into revenue service.
This contrasts with the conventional overhead electrification program which can only commence
electrified rail services on a rail corridor once all the infrastructure is in place.
Aligning the implementation of the RER track and signalling improvements with the development
of the HFC-powered rail vehicles creates the opportunity for an initial fleet of these vehicles to be
introduced into service on one corridor earlier than the planned start of RER services in 2025. This
would enable Metrolinx to build up a level of experience in the operation and performance of the
vehicles that could be fed into the development and build of the remaining vehicles in the fleet on
the other corridors.



By adopting the Hydrail System it will be possible to eventually operate electrified RER services
over the full GO network rather than the scope of corridors that is currently planned for RER. This
means that, over time, all the remaining diesel locomotives could be removed from the network
with the additional environmental benefits in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, pollution,
and noise reductions.



Implementing the Hydrail System could act as a catalyst for a broader adoption of hydrogen
throughout Ontario as part of a potential roadmap for a hydrogen economy in Ontario1. There are

opportunities to align the Hydrail System’s hydrogen production, storage, and distribution
infrastructure with the similar infrastructure needed to support HFC-powered buses and cars. The
investment in an integrated infrastructure for these complementary requirements would be far
more cost effective than if the systems were developed individually.


There are possible broader socio-economic benefits that could be experienced by Ontario as a
result of implementing the Hydrail System. These include:


Development of opportunities for businesses in the hydrogen and the fuel cell sector. Ontario
already has some businesses that are focussed on producing components of the Hydrail
System. These businesses are likely to benefit from implementing a system on the scale of
Hydrail



This in turn is likely to lead to an expansion in the number of high skilled jobs that would be
required in these businesses and in the operation and maintenance of the Hydrail System

Taking forward the development of those opportunities which are beyond Metrolinx’s transportation
mandate will require consideration and guidance from the Provincial government.

Recommended Next Steps

While the study concludes that it is technically and economically feasible to build and operate the GO
network using HFC-powered rail vehicles, it has also identified aspects of the Hydrail System that
warrant further investigation to support the RER procurement process.
The proposed next steps are focussed on alignment with the RER procurement strategy which will be
open to both the Hydrail System and conventional electrification options.
The primary objective of this alignment is to enable the design of the whole Hydrail System to be
taken forward to a conceptual design level so that by the time the RER bidders start to prepare their
bids they will have access to high quality information about the design and operation of the Hydrail
System. This will enable the bidders to accurately assess the risks and benefits of Hydrail System in
comparison to electrification using the conventional overhead catenary system.
It is proposed that further work is undertaken in those areas of the Hydrail System where the bidders
are likely to want a greater level of certainty than currently exists, at the completion of the feasibility
study. These are:


Design:


Complete the projects to create conceptual designs for an HFC bi-level EMU and an HFC
locomotive



Refine the Hydrail System configuration and size in the Operational Simulation model, including
development of concept designs for hydrogen production, storage and fuelling subsystems



Prototyping: Commission the production of a prototype HFC locomotive that can enter revenue
service, including the development and prototyping of the refuelling and hydrogen production
subsystems that can work with the prototype HFC locomotive so that Metrolinx can learn valuable
lessons concerning the Hydrail System’s operations, performance, and reliability



Railway operations: Further investigate the operational areas of the Hydrail System such as
maintenance and refuelling



Cost: Recognizing that the Hydrail System would represent a new approach to delivering RER,
collaborate with industry vendors to further investigate infrastructure and vehicle delivery and
operational costs



Implementation: Further define the development and build phases and the transition plan
required to initiate a Hydrail System on the GO network



Hydrogen production: Identify location options for the hydrogen production facilities



Regulations: Work with the safety regulators at the federal and provincial levels to reach clarity on
the regulatory environment that will apply to Hydrail



Electricity price policy: Work with the provincial government to develop an electricity price policy
that could be applied to the Hydrail System



Hydrogen economy: Work with the provincial government to develop a cross-government
business case for hydrogen (including the Hydrail System)



Align with the RER procurement process: Integrate the outputs from these steps into a Hydrail
System Reference Concept Design that can be used in the RER procurement process

Introduction

2.1

Purpose and Objective of the Study

The Hydrail Feasibility Study Project was initiated because Metrolinx is committed to electrifying the
GO network and using hydrogen fuel cell technology to power rail vehicles is now being considered
as a viable alternative to rail vehicles powered by an overhead catenary wire system.
Therefore, the objective of the study has been to determine whether it is technologically feasible and
economically beneficial to use hydrogen fuel cell powered rail vehicles on the GO network, as an
alternative to conventional electrification.

2.2

Metrolinx Hydrail Workstream Overview

The feasibility study was undertaken as one project within a program of projects called the Metrolinx
Hydrail Workstream. The other projects in this workstream are shown on Figure 2-1.
FIGURE 2-1 THE HYDRAIL WORKSTREAM

HFC Bi-Level EMU Concept Design Project
As part of the proposed Regional Express Rail (RER) train services it is intended to operate bi-level
Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) rail vehicles in consists of four cars and eight cars. In the Hydrail System
these would be replaced by Hydrogen Fuel Cell (HFC)-powered bi-level EMUs.
The objective of this project is to commission rail vehicle manufacturers, who already have bi-level
EMU models, to produce conceptual designs for a HFC-powered bi-level EMU that can meet the
requirements of the RER service patterns.

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

The conceptual designs will prove the feasibility of integrating an HFC system into an EMU and will
provide valuable information about the likely cost and timescales to develop, manufacture and bring
this type of EMU into revenue service.
HFC Locomotive Project
As part of the proposed RER train services, it is intended to operate electric locomotives pulling the
existing fleet of unpowered coaches in 12-car consists. In the Hydrail System, these would be replaced
with two smaller HFC-powered locomotives.
The objective of this project is to commission rail vehicle manufacturers, who already have electric
locomotive models, to produce conceptual designs for an HFC-powered locomotive that can meet
the requirements of the RER service patterns – in this case it will be a locomotive in a six-car consist.
Metrolinx has already completed an initial phase of work that has verified the feasibility of integrating
a HFC system into a locomotive platform. It now intends to engage rail vehicle manufacturers to take
these ideas forward to the concept design level.
The conceptual designs will further demonstrate how an HFC system can be integrated into a
locomotive platform, and will provide valuable information about the likely cost and timescales to
develop, manufacture, and bring this type of locomotive into revenue service.
At the completion of the conceptual design phase, it is Metrolinx’s intention to commission the
detailed design and construction of a prototype HFC-powered locomotive that can be used on the
GO network. This will provide multiple benefits including gaining experience operating an HFC rail
vehicle, and with the refuelling process, its maintenance requirements, it performance, and its
reliability.
Hydrail Symposium Project
As part of the scope of the Hydrail Workstream, a 1-day symposium titled “Hydrail in Ontario:
Examining Opportunities for Wireless Electrification” was held in Toronto on November 16, 2017.
The objectives of the symposium were to:


Educate and inform an audience of interested Metrolinx and government stakeholders about the
opportunities and implications of using a Hydrail System



Learn about global and Canadian developments in the use of hydrogen technologies



Obtain the views of the participants on what the key challenges would likely be if Metrolinx
implemented the Hydrail System and identify how these challenges could be overcome

The symposium was attended by more than 200 participants and key speakers included:


Steven Del Duca – Minister of Transportation



Phil Verster – Metrolinx Chief Executive Officer (CEO)



Hydrogen Overview

The objective of Part 3 is to provide the reader with an understanding of the various technologies that
underpin the use of hydrogen as a stored power source and provide examples of existing hydrogen
related projects that are relevant to the Hydrail concept.
It will include a summary of the technologies, their capabilities and current capacity plus commentary
on the maturity of these technologies. This will include:


Hydrogen generation



Storage



Distribution



Fueling



On vehicle storage



Reconversion of hydrogen to power (fuel cells), and



Ancillary equipment such as on vehicle batteries and regenerative breaking.

This is intended to provide a basis of understanding that is then used in Part 4 where the Hydrail
System, as applied to the GO network, is defined.

3.1

Introduction to Hydrogen

This section provides background knowledge on hydrogen as a fuel and energy storage solution, and
the technologies that support the hydrogen system, converting natural gas or generated electricity to
hydrogen for temporary energy storage, and back from hydrogen to electricity to power electrical
equipment. The discussion in this section provides basic information and confidence that the
technology is developed, modular, off-the-shelf, and has established levels of performance.
Hydrogen atoms permeate the Universe. Yet on Earth, while hydrogen is abundant and essential to
life, it is always chemically combined—particularly in the form of water and, to a lesser extent, as oil
and gas—because any free hydrogen quickly combines with oxygen in the air. However, there are
simple ways to produce pure hydrogen from water, hydrocarbons, or both. The simplest approach is
by passing an electric current through water, the process known as electrolysis, which can easily be
arranged to produce pure streams of hydrogen and oxygen. Every school chemistry lab routinely
demonstrates this process, which is illustrated on Figure 3-1.

FIGURE 3-1 SCHEMATIC OF WATER ELECTROLYSIS PROCESS2

Water always contains ions in the form of positively charged hydrogen ions (H+) and negatively
charged hydroxyl ions (OH-). By passing an electric current—a stream of negatively charged electrons—
H+ are neutralized and converted into molecules of hydrogen gas (H2) at the cathode. Meanwhile, at
the anode, the applied current is stripping electrons from hydroxyl ions and converting them into
molecules of oxygen gas and neutral water molecules. The only input is a substantial amount of
electrical energy; in theory, about 39.3 kilowatt-hours (kWh) to produce 1 kilogram (kg) of hydrogen.
(In practice, some electrical energy is lost, and 50 kWh/kg is typical.)
The bulk of the electrical energy is now stored in the hydrogen and can be retrieved by reversing the
electrolysis process in what is called a fuel cell. Combined with the lightness of hydrogen, the
relatively large amount of energy that is stored when water is converted into hydrogen means that the
reverse of converting hydrogen back to water is an exceptionally low-weight source of energy.
For trains, primary energy could come from onboard supplies of hydrogen; this is Hydrail. Hydrogen
is just one of a number of energy currencies and, like monetary currencies3, are interchangeable. So
Hydrail’s energy originates in electricity from the grid. The first currency conversion happens at a
convenient, fixed location where electricity is converted into hydrogen. The hydrogen is then loaded
onto trains.

A second currency conversion occurs when hydrogen is reconverted into electricity to power the train
(Figure 3-2)4. Although it is also possible to convert hydrogen into heat energy by burning it, its direct
conversion to electricity is advantageous both because it is a more efficient conversion and because
electricity is a more versatile form of energy.

Hydrogen Technology

3.2.1

Hydrogen Production Options

Hydrogen has to be manufactured with engineered processes. Electrolysis is one of four process
technologies that can produce hydrogen, as shown in Figure 3-3.
FIGURE 3-3 HYDROGEN PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGIES

Fossil Carbon Processes convert the energy in hydrocarbons to pure hydrogen by several routes. The
currently predominant route to hydrogen reforms natural gas by steam-methane reforming (SMR) and
similar variations on this technology. This is an energy-efficient process, and today produces about
96 percent of the hydrogen essential to converting oil into usable refined products. However, SMR
processes also co-produce one CO2 molecule for every four molecules of hydrogen.
Using SMR and other CO2-producing variations to produce hydrogen is questionable because there is
also the possibility of producing hydrogen and pure carbon from natural gas. This is called partial
reduction. It is recognized as an interesting possibility, since the carbon is produced in a stable form
that would not require sequestration. However, partial reduction and SMR both require processing
CH4, which is a powerful greenhouse gas (GHG). Partial reduction is also an inefficient process, since it
produces only half as much hydrogen as an SMR process, and industrial-scale processes for partial
reduction are undeveloped.

Carbon-Neutral Processes rely on diverse biological processes capturing CO2 from the atmosphere,
the release of hydrogen from their products, and return of the CO2 to the atmosphere. However, they
are inefficient and not available on a large scale.
Sulphur-iodine, copper chloride, and high-temperature electrolysis are the principal ThermoChemical Processes that are currently under development for large-scale hydrogen production but
are not currently commercially available. While all use some input of electrical energy, a substantial
proportion of the input energy comes from heat. So, electricity usage would be reduced and
somewhat higher input prices accommodated.
The advantages of the water electrolysis process over other hydrogen production technologies
include:


GHG-free: If the electricity is from a GHG-free generator, then electrolysis is the simplest GHG-free
hydrogen production technology in terms of fewer processes required to obtain hydrogen.



Modular: Additional capacity for hydrogen requires the addition of electrolyzer stacks.



Clean process: During operation, only electricity and water are used to make hydrogen; no
additional chemicals or raw materials are needed.



Simple O&M: There are no moving parts within the electrolyzer stack, so operational issues arising
from such mechanical interactions and periodic maintenance requirements are minimal.



Load-following: Electrolysis provides the ability to follow the demand for hydrogen and use
electrical grid time periods with cheaper electricity prices.



Simpler decommissioning: After the lifetime operation of the plant, decommissioning is much
simpler due to the limited number of parts and accessories.

For these reasons, it is proposed that the Hydrail System uses water electrolysis instead of the other
technologies.

3.2.1.1 Hydrogen Production Scale
This section describes the breakdown and scale of hydrogen global production capacity, production
sources, and consumption markets.
On Figure 3-4, the “Merchant” component of global capacity is the significant feature, since it
represents the 23,000 tonnes of hydrogen that is produced for dispersed consumption. (The
remainder is produced and used locally, either within a plant site or over the fence from a separate
supplier.) The 4 percent or 5,500 tonnes per day (tpd) produced globally by electrolysis is widely
dispersed and largely corresponds to the 4 percent of consumption categorized as “General”. Its uses
are diverse, including hydrogenation of vegetable oils, various steel-making applications, passivation
of semiconductors, and use as a launch fuel for some space vehicles.

FIGURE 3-4 GLOBAL INDUSTRIAL HYDROGEN PRODUCTION CAPACITY, PRODUCTION, AND CONSUMPTION

About 1,500 tpd of hydrogen is produced and consumed by industry (mainly, refineries) in Canada6.
These numbers highlight the availability of knowledge and expertise in Canada and across the globe
in handling large volumes of hydrogen daily. The hydrogen requirement for the Hydrail System within
the GO network would be an order of magnitude smaller in scale than the current daily Canadian
production of hydrogen and comparable to the existing scale of electrolytic production.

3.2.2

Placing Hydrogen in Context

To reduce emissions, various options exist for displacement of petroleum fuels for different forms of
transportation, most depending on electricity as the intermediate source, produced by primary lowemitting energy source, such as nuclear, hydraulic, wind, or solar. Electricity is predominantly sourced
from a grid, so has distinctive differences from other primary energy sources: it cannot be directly
applied beyond the reach of the grid, and it cannot be stored. For some transportation applications,
extending the grid to track electrification for trains and trolley vehicles is an option. Otherwise, for
vehicle applications, electricity has to be captured chemically. This can be by transforming chemicals
in batteries (for example, by converting lithium cobalt oxide [LiCoO2] to lithium metal in lithium ion
batteries [LIBs], or by synthesizing a fuel, usually by changing water into hydrogen).
As discussed in Section 3.2.11, since today’s battery technology is impractical for high-frequency,
high-capacity, high-speed trains, the practicable choices for applying electricity to these types of rail
transportation is either to do so directly through track electrification or indirectly by converting
hydrogen to electricity on-board the train, using a fuel cell.
The hydrogen production, hydrogen storage, and electricity production processes would form part of
an overall Hydrail System for the GO network. These processes and associated subsystems are
described in the next sections.

The Hydrail System

The Hydrail System is shown on Figure 3-5. The technology for each of the subsystems in the overall
system is described in the following sections.
FIGURE 3-5 THE HYDRAIL SYSTEM

3.2.3.1 Ontario’s Electricity Supply
Ontario’s electricity grid draws over 90 percent of its electricity from a mix of nuclear, hydraulic, wind,
and solar sources, which share the advantage of being low-emitting. Ontario’s grid is comparable to
the provinces of Quebec, Manitoba, and British Columbia in being green, emitting very little CO2. But
where these other provinces derive their electricity predominantly from controllable hydroelectric
(hydro) sources, Ontario’s green generating sources have limited or no capability to adjust to the
varying load demand on the grid. The collective result is intermittent excess capacity averaging over
1,000 megawatts (MW)7.
Over the 20-year period from 2016-2035, an average annual surplus of 12.2 terawatt-hours (TWh) is
predicted by an independent assessment of the Ontario grid8. This is representative of the surplus
that would exist due to additional baseload generation required to meet the province’s GHG
reduction targets for 2030 and 2050. This includes new generation of 20 to 40 TWh of electricity
required by 2025, per the assessment of Ontario’s 2013 Long-term Energy Plan9. This considers the
loss of 20 TWh of clean baseload generation from the closure of Pickering Nuclear Generating Station
(PNGS)10.
While projections are speculative, there is reasonable certainty that shorter-term mismatches between
supply and demand will continue to exist, driven both by fluctuations in daily electricity demand and
fluctuating generation by renewable technologies on multiple time scales. Details of how Hydrail
could access this fluctuating surplus of electricity over demand are discussed in Sections 4.2.2.1
and 4.3.

Track electrification has no flexibility in the use of electricity, and its demand will peak at times of
existing peaks of electricity demand on the Ontario grid. While it uses only about one-third of the
electricity consumed by Hydrail, track electrification’s use of electricity at peak periods will likely be
derived in substantial proportion from CO2-emitting gas-fired generation.
With Hydrail, electricity will overwhelmingly be consumed at times of off-peak demand when gas-fired
generation levels are low to nonexistent. So, despite using three times as much electricity as track
electrification, Hydrail would draw less than 7 percent of its electricity input from gas-fired sources
and could be comparably effective as electrification for RER decarbonization. Either approach will
produce less than 20 percent of emissions from diesel traction. This is discussed in detail in
Section 4.2.

3.2.4

Hydrogen Fuel Production

3.2.4.1 Hydrogen Production by Water Electrolysis
There are two alternative approaches to electrolysis technology. The long-established approach uses
either potassium or sodium hydroxide as an electrolyte to allow the current to pass through a
reservoir of water (to create alkaline cells). The newer approach uses SMR technology as protonexchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, but operated in reverse and not requiring the presence of an
electrolyte.
Both technologies are well-established11, and the choice between them is an economic one, based on
capital cost, cell efficiency, maintenance frequency, and the ability to handle high-current densities.
Alkaline cells require very little maintenance; PEM cells need to be periodically rebuilt (at around
30,000 hours of operation) due to slow membrane deterioration. PEM cells have more flexibility to
accept high-current densities when electricity is most affordable.
Producing and handling hydrogen on the scale needed for the RER GO network is not a significant
issue. Using SMR, individual oil refineries consume hydrogen at two to four times the entire RER
requirement. Though usually operated on a much smaller scale, electrolytic production is a longestablished alternative method wherever very high purity is required and the technology is
intrinsically modular.

3.2.4.2 Reliability, Maintainability, and Safety
With many industrial processes, equipment needs increase as demand for the product grows—the
classic “scale-up.” This is not the case with water electrolysis, which is a modular technology. Using
proven modules of 3- to 10-MW capacity (50 to 150 kg/h of hydrogen), the total deployment needed
for the RER GO network is handled by deploying the appropriate number of modules.
Water electrolysis using alkaline cells has been in use on an industrial scale for over a century.
Because they have few moving parts (pumps and compressors), the cells have been found to require
very little maintenance. With the category of alkaline cells, there are two broad classifications: unipolar
and bipolar12. CNL used a unipolar installation to produce deuterium (heavy hydrogen) gas
commercially for 25 to 30 years with almost no maintenance and total reliability.

groups.

Out of four individual cells, one gas separator replacement was required, and gaskets had to be
replaced twice. Another cell operated in a prototype plant for 2.5 years without problems. With
bipolar cells, fabrication from nickel is advisable to avoid corrosion from stray currents. Discussion
with A. Stuart, who was Technical Manager of the Electrolyzer Corporation (Canada’s main supplier of
alkaline cells for more than 50 years) confirmed CNL’s experience: alkaline cells will operate for 20 to
30 years before they need to be refurbished and have lifetimes of 50 years13.
Experience with the newer technology of PEM cells has so far been similar, but the separator of a PEM
cell is an exception. Where alkaline cells need a physical barrier to separate the gases, the membrane
in a PEM cell is a more active component, allowing the passage of protons. This is an operations issue,
with replacement of this membrane needed when the cell voltage becomes too high. Because the
impact on the membrane is cumulative with hours of operation, and the Hydrail cells are not operated
continuously, cell rebuild for membrane replacement is estimated to be needed after about 7 years.
Water electrolysis using alkaline cells has been in use on an industrial scale for over a century. The few
moving parts are pumps and compressors, and the cells require very little maintenance. Installations
have operated for decades with very high reliability.
Both alkaline and PEM electrolyzers have excellent safety characteristics14, with the reservation that
hydrogen purity deteriorates with oxygen contamination when the cells are operated at higher
pressures. This is not a significant issue in the pressure range (up to 3 megapascals [MPa]) used in this
assessment.
A master’s thesis by Joonas Koponen15 gives an excellent overview of electrolyzer technology.
Koponen notes that, compared to the alkaline type, the PEM type of electrolyzer has much lower
cross-over contamination, and ability to operate over a wide range of current density and to respond
easily to varying current. Only operation above 100 bar (which is not envisaged) requires the use of
thicker membranes. Koponen continues:
“The gas crossover rate is much lower than in alkaline water electrolyzers enabling the
use of almost the whole range of rated power. Additionally, the solid polymer
membrane enables the electrolyzer to respond more quickly to fluctuations in the input
power. Thus, PEM electrolyzers can be operated in a much more dynamic fashion than
alkaline electrolyzers.”
As with almost all situations where hydrogen is produced, stored, or used, providing good ventilation
backed up with hydrogen detectors can completely avoid buildup of hydrogen concentrations in air
that could support ignition. Electrolytic cells need protection from freezing conditions, so the building
where they are housed must be designed to accomplish proper ventilation with interlocks to shut
down electrolysis if the ventilation system fails. While proper ventilation design is sufficient, this can
easily be backed up by incorporating large blow-out panels in the building walls to ensure that a
deflagration cannot transform into detonation. Additional information on safety is provided in
Appendix B.

Fuel Storage – Gaseous and Liquid Hydrogen

The Hydrail concept includes intermittent production of hydrogen with the electrolyzers operating, at
times, dictated by the price of electricity and operating requirements of the Ontario grid.
Consequently, hydrogen has to be stored. There is a second storage requirement for a supply of
hydrogen to be available for overnight train refuelling. Those requirements are both land-based.
A third storage requirement is the mobile one for storage on the trains.
There are four different storage technology types relevant to the Hydrail project, as shown on
Figure 3-6. Hydrogen storage is a key component when handling hydrogen from production to
application, with distinction in terms of location of storage: stationary (fixed in location), and mobile
(onboard vehicles). The storage technologies have evolved based on the following characteristics,
similar to other energy storage technologies,16 such as batteries, compressed air, and pumped hydro.


Time-driven: The duration of storage dictates the type and form of storage required, both in terms
of physical and economic limitations. For example, storing in the liquid phase is not advisable
beyond 3 to 5 days due to boil-off and consequent loss of hydrogen to avoid storage tank
overpressurization. Underground storage17 can hold a large volume of gas for months and has the
potential to smooth seasonally variable production—similarly to the widely used storage of natural
gas.



Space-driven: The density of storage is a key component that determines two aspects of storage:
volume of storage, and space required for that volume of storage. Depending on the application
and storage location, compressed gas and liquid are two potential phases to store hydrogen.
Liquid hydrogen provides almost double the density of compressed gas at 70 MPa. Solid phase
storage through metal and chemical hydrides provides comparable densities to 70 MPa gas but
not the transfer rates required for the volume of hydrogen involved with the Hydrail application.



Demand-driven: Storage of hydrogen is tied closely to the delivery characteristics, such as the
transfer rates and losses. If large and permanent demand exists for hydrogen in a region,
expanding perhaps beyond Hydrail for the RER system, then pipeline distribution and storage18
could be used to buffer storage and provide reliability. The lengths of pipelines could be anything
from short links between a hydrogen production site and a nearby fuelling point, to a network of
pipelines across the RER network.

Figure 3-6 illustrates the storage options.
FIGURE 3-6 HYDROGEN STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES RELEVANT TO HYDRAIL

3.2.5.1 Design and Functionality
Compressed gaseous hydrogen is stored in cylinders, tanks, or vessels, depending on the pressure.
For pressures up to 20 MPa and stationary storage, gas can be stored in large tanks made of carbon
or stainless steels, similar to the way propane is stored. For high-pressure storage, there are four types
of pressure vessels, depending on the construction, application, and pressure requirements. Types I
and II are for stationary storage applications, while Types III and IV are for mobile storage applications.
The energy inputs for gaseous and liquid hydrogen differ significantly, as follows:


For both forms, the estimated total energy to produce hydrogen at 2 MPa by electrolysis is
65 kilowatt-hours per kilogram (kWh/kg). There are expectations for modest reductions in the
future, since it is currently almost double hydrogen’s lower heating value (LHV)19.

19 All hydrogen-containing fuels have two heating values, depending on whether the energy released does (the higher heating value) or
does not (the lower heating value, LHV) include the heat released when water vapour condenses. This is particularly significant for hydrogen,
since its only product of combustion is water.



For gaseous storage, the subsequent compression to 90 MPa (to facilitate fast filling of locomotive
tanks at 70 MPa) and cooling to -40 degrees Celsius (°C) requires about 8 percent additional
energy (including the total energy to produce and compress the hydrogen).

To produce liquid hydrogen (LH2) requires about 17 percent additional energy. This is an undesirably
large premium, unless there are circumstances that make use of LH2 inescapable. There is little hope
that the additional energy for liquefaction can be reduced.20

3.2.5.2 Reliability, Maintainability, and Safety
Handling hydrogen (produced by electrolysis or otherwise) is very well-established. Probably because
of its perception of being hazardous, hydrogen attracts close attention to its containment, handling,
ventilation, and avoidance of ignition sources. Providing good ventilation—either through frequent air
changes or being open to the outdoors—is backed up by deployment of hydrogen detectors
interlocked to shut down operation. Over 50 years of working with hydrogen for extensive
experimental usage and protracted production of deuterium gas, CNL has experienced no significant
events attributable to hydrogen, and only a handful of instances when minor leaks were detected.
Gaseous hydrogen is becoming well-characterized as a fuel for transportation applications. There is
less experience with liquid hydrogen. That it is a liquid and extremely cold are additional
considerations for its safe handling. As a transport fuel, it has so far been mostly used as a propulsion
material in some rockets for space launches by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA). Through its use for cryogenic separation of hydrogen isotopes, CNL has had limited
experience with its use and with no significant problems. LH2 does require some additional measures
not needed for gas storage, such as selection of proper materials (stainless steel or aluminum but not
carbon steel, which is brittle at very low temperatures) and providing measures for rapid, controlled
dumping of LH2 should there be a loss of vacuum in the containing vessel.
There are arguments for and against the two storage forms, as LH2 or as compressed hydrogen gas
(CGH2), as follows:


Storage: LH2 volumes are a little over half that for CGH2. Onboard storage could turn out to be
particularly difficult with CGH2; diesel multiple units (DMUs) will be more difficult than locomotives
in this respect.



Train fuelling will probably be faster with LH2 but requires more elaborate equipment to
handle -253°C cold21. After the first fill with LH2—when the tank has to be cooled—filling is
straightforward. With CGH2, some precooling will always be required to offset the heat from
hydrogen’s adiabatic expansion.



Safety is manageable with both, and losses are rare in any circumstance. With CGH2, losses from
the extremely robust cylinders are improbable and would disperse rapidly. With LH2, leakage or

from ortho-para conversion is greater than the heat of liquefaction (0.45 megajoule per kilogram [MJ/kg]); it has to be catalyzed or will lead
to vaporization when it occurs spontaneously because it’s about 18 percent of the existing total (approximately 2.5 kWh/kg). The Praxair
report contains the statement that “Liquid hydrogen might not be the best way to supply the ‘Hydrogen Economy’, but it will play a
significant role in the transition period.”

losses, though highly improbable, are perhaps somewhat more plausible, and they would
disperse more slowly.


Neither fuel form is familiar to the public, so they would need to be educated to gain their
support. The case for CGH2 could be marginally easier, particularly since it is already widely in
operation.

LH2 for onboard use has the added requirement of providing equipment to vaporize the liquid,
except initially, using heat from the fuel cells.
CGH2 has been the fuel chosen so far by almost all adopters of HFCs. Approximately 11,000 fuel cell
forklifts were in daily use in North America in 201622. Most of these devices are made by PlugPower
and are located in the United States (U.S.)23. Fuel cell material handling equipment (MHE) remain the
most successful fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) to date. The application of fuel cell MHE in other regions has
not been comparable to the U.S. due to smaller fleets, fewer operating hours, different regulations,
and lower subsidies. The DOE reports that approximately $10 million in funding was allocated to the
MHE sector through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Fuel-cell-powered forklifts
provide the most extensive application of the technology so far, and can be managed like railway
applications. No safety problems have been reported from these or other applications. Additional
information on safety is provided in Appendix B.

3.2.6

Fuel Distribution

Fuel distribution for Hydrail is only required for certain infrastructure scenarios. For example, if the
hydrogen production is located at a distance away from the GO network, then the fuel needs to be
brought to the refuelling facilities, similar to diesel being brought from distribution centres across the
GTHA. For a scenario where the hydrogen production is near the refuelling stations, fuel distribution
may not be required.
There are two types of fuel distribution currently being considered by the study: pipeline distribution
of hydrogen, and trucking of hydrogen.
Trucks are currently used by gas companies to transport hydrogen from production facilities to
industrial customers. For the scale needed for the RER system, hydrogen pipelines will be needed,
either locally or extensively, though they could be supplemented by truck transport.
While pipelines lack the flexibility of trucking, they are a cheaper option when hydrogen is being
moved on daily, large scales. In such cases, there is the need for local piping to connect trains to highpressure supply tanks and those tanks to the source of the hydrogen. Whether pipes long enough to
be thought of as a pipeline are needed will depend on whether hydrogen is produced close to the
refuelling points.
When the scale of use is large enough, it is possible to contemplate the possibility of extensive
distribution by smallish (approximately 150-mm diameter) pipelines, but this assessment depends on
where hydrogen will be produced. Hydrogen-only pipelines of various lengths up to hundreds of
kilometres operate in several locations, including Alberta and the Sarnia area of Ontario. The
technology is fairly similar to natural gas distribution, except that pipe materials have to be selected

for hydrogen compatibility (that is, using stainless steel rather than high-strength carbon steel
because the latter is susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement). No instances of a hydrogen pipeline
rupturing have been reported.

3.2.6.1 Design and Functionality
Hydrogen fuel for Hydrail would be produced by electrolysis using electricity from the Ontario
electricity grid. This introduces some complexity, as well as great flexibility. The electrolysis load is
substantial, so locations of interface with the grid need to be selected with reference to excess or
restricted current-carrying capabilities. Should it be necessary to address this constraint, hydrogen
could most readily be transferred to refuelling points by buried pipelines with diameters of the order
of 150 millimetres (mm). One possibility would be to route such pipelines along track rights-of-way
(ROWs).
Choice of locations for generation is for a future, more detailed level of study: sites could be
distributed around the RER network or centralized; they could be close to refuelling points, or located
remotely with longer pipelines. One possible concept, which is used by the petrochemical and
refinery industries, is a single network of interconnected pipelines with more than one point of
hydrogen injection and multiple draw-off locations. Because of hydrogen’s very low viscosity, designs
can incorporate little or no pumping, with hydrogen moving within the pipeline network in response
to pressure gradients.

3.2.6.2 Reliability, Maintainability, and Safety
Pipelines distributing gas use well-established technology and are reliable. Gas pipelines are mainly
vulnerable to external impacts, so should be either buried or, slightly less securely, elevated. If, as
envisaged, both short pipelines for train fuelling and longer pipelines for wider distribution are
entirely on railway land, this should achieve a high level of security. The technology to detect and
isolate leakage from a hydrogen-gas pipeline is identical to the standard practice of the natural gas
industry. Insulated, short pipelines for refuelling with LH2 would require more extensive engineering
and could not be buried. Road shipment by tanker of both gaseous and liquid hydrogen is routine
and provides a means of backing up pipeline supply should the primary electrolytic supply be
temporarily disrupted. Additional information on safety is provided in Appendix B.

3.2.7

Refuelling and Dispensing

Refuelling and dispensing comprises buffer storage tanks (refuelling tanks) and the hydrogen transfer
unit (dispensing using) that connects to the tail vehicle for fuelling – similar to a diesel fuel pump.
These would most likely be sited in facilities similar to where diesel fuelling occurs today within the
GO network.

3.2.7.1 Design and Functionality
Refuelling is a distinctive feature for Hydrail, unlike track electrification but akin to existing diesel
operation. Design for fast refuelling of up to one or two tonnes of hydrogen for a single locomotive is
a significant but surmountable design challenge. Fast refuelling with CGH2 in 2 minutes for hydrogenfuelled cars is routine, using a verified gas-tight connector, but the quantities for a locomotive are two
orders of magnitude larger, somewhat less for individual EMUs.
If the system used LH2, fuelling would be very similar to that for diesels with gas-tight connections. For
fuelling rail vehicles with gaseous hydrogen, the existing technology can be adapted to fit the Hydrail

application without major redesign using a combination of multiple nozzles, moderate enlargement of
nozzles, and lengthened refuelling time.
The design draws lessons from similar setup for other hydrogen applications in the transportation
sector, including cars and buses, as shown on Figure 3-7. The schematic provides a view of the
hydrogen being transmitted from the storage and distribution (via pipeline at 2 MPa) to the refuelling
system, which has a cascade of tanks (S-1, S-2, and S-3) and valves at higher pressure (87.5 MPa). The
gas would be pressurized from the supply at 2 to 87.5 MPa using a series of compressors (C-1),
depending on the volume of gas being compressed. The gas is transferred to the tank onboard the
FCV, which is at a relatively lower pressure (70 MPa). To achieve enough transfer rates of gaseous
hydrogen when it expands from 87.5 to 70 MPa, the gas needs to be cooled to -35 to -40° C using the
cooling machine. For operational reliability and safety, devices such as temperature sensors (T),
pressure indicators (P-1, P-2), control valves, and pressure relief valves (PSV) are used.

CARS24

CGH2 will be dispensed from track-side tanks at 85 to 100 MPa, either pre-cooled or passed through a
heat-exchanger to chill it to -40°C (to accommodate hydrogen’s heat of expansion), and connected to
the train using existing technology for secure transfer of compressed gaseous fuels. The limiting
factor for rates of gas fuelling is understood to be a maximum feed rate to individual tanks of
8 kg/min. However, since the storage will be configured to as many as 20 individual tanks, this does
not pose a significant constraint.
Fuelling with liquid hydrogen would be similar to that for diesel fuel, except the design must
accommodate the very low temperature of the fluid, and be connected with a leak-tight seal.

3.2.7.2 Reliability, Maintainability, and Safety
The location of refuelling points will depend on future discussions with RER Operations. Refuelling
would be an upgraded version of the existing process.
For onboard storage of CGH2 at the proposed standard pressure of 70 MPa, the existing technology
for refuelling cars and buses needs to be upgraded, probably complemented by using several
connection points to meet the specified target for refuelling time. These aspects of Hydrail all depend
on existing technology.
The U.S. Government’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy states25:
“High-pressure tanks (3,600 psi [250 bar]) have been used safely in compressed
natural gas vehicles (NGV) for many years. Improved versions of these tanks made of
high-strength composite materials are now used to store hydrogen at higher pressures
(5,000 [350 bar] and 10,000 psi [700 bar]) to achieve greater driving range in
hydrogen-fueled vehicles. High-pressure hydrogen tanks are designed not to rupture
and are held to rigorous performance requirements. Furthermore, these tanks undergo
extensive testing to make sure that they meet these performance requirements.”
A pressure of 700 bar is envisaged for on-board gas storage for Hydrail. Since the Hydrail design is
modular, these storage tanks will have dimensions — particularly diameter — that match the
configurations used extensively in other vehicle applications. These tanks have been in service for at
least a decade with extensively tested performance. In 2010, the DOE’s Argonne Lab issued an
assessment report on both the 350-bar and 700-bar tanks. Of note, the tanks are designed and tested
to accept 25 percent overpressure to allow for excursions during fast filling. They are rated for
5,500 cycles of filling26. For Hydrail, the network of tanks needs to be engineered; but reliability,
availability, maintainability, and safety (RAMS) present no uncharted issues. Refuelling locations
should always be equipped with leak detectors — these are intrinsic to the nozzles with locked fittings—
and either be provided with good ventilation or open-air dispersion. Additional information on safety
is provided in Appendix B.

Vehicle Propulsion: Hydrogen Fuel Cells

The fuel cell is at the core of the fuel cell based propulsion system for both light- and heavy-duty
vehicular applications, as shown on Figure 3-8. The fuel cell delivers electricity in the form of direct
current (DC) to electrically charge the onboard batteries. While more discussion on fuel cells and
batteries is available in the next two sections, a brief description of the drive motors is required to
understand the technologies and the preference for Hydrail.
The batteries divert some of the electricity (DC) to a convertor that modulates the direct current with
phase difference to achieve an alternating current (AC) to power an AC motor or to a converter that

balances DC voltage to power a DC motor. For heavy-duty vehicles, including locomotives, AC
motors are preferred over DC motors for these reasons27:


AC motors are simpler to construct, they require no mechanical contacts to work, such as brushes,
although newer DC motors have no brushes either.



AC motors are lighter than DC motors for equivalent power.



Modern electronics allow AC motors to be controlled effectively to improve both adhesion and
traction.



AC motors can be microprocessor controlled to a fine degree, and can regenerate current down
to almost a stop; whereas, DC regeneration fades quickly at low speeds.



AC motors are more robust and easier to maintain than DC motors.

The AC or DC motor would then deliver the traction power through the gear box and axle drive train
to spin the wheels to move the vehicle.

Energy in the form of heat can also be produced by burning hydrogen gas in the presence of oxygen
to produce water. Howerver, heat engines are fundamentally limited by what is known as Carnot
efficiency and consequently, heat engines rarely achieve 40 percent efficiency in their conversion of
the energy content of the fuel. Whereas fuel cells are not constrained by Carnot and efficiencies of 50
to 60 percent are attainable.
There are a number of fuel cell technologies. These are summarized in a study of fuel cells for ships

Where hydrogen is the fuel, electricity, water, and heat are the only products of the chemical reactions
that occur in different segments of the fuel cell. HFCs can have almost twice the efficiency of
traditional combustions technologies30. For instance, a conventional fossil fuel power plant typically

level of up to 60 percent. In addition, fuel cells also operate quietly and have fewer moving parts
compared to conventional methods of producing electricity. They are also extremely compact, far
smaller than a classical internal combustion engine.

vehicle applications (notably, forklifts). The main reason for slow commercialization of fuel cells in

other sectors, including transportation, is not the technology itself, but the lack of infrastructure, which
has to be in place to allow the technology to be widely adopted.
The modularity and linear addition of cells to make stacks of various sizes and shape to fit the
application makes fuel cells a much sought-after propulsion technology for different vehicle types.
The ability to fill onboard tanks with hydrogen quicker than charging batteries for battery-electric
vehicles (BEVs) is another practical attraction to fuel-cell-electric vehicles (FCEVs). The additional
range can be added to vehicles at the design phase by merely adding a tank of H2, which is much
lighter than the equivalent weight of batteries for the same range.
The Hydrogen Council has recently published their overview of the roles best suited to BEVs and
FCEVs, shown on Figure 3-10.
The attributes of HFCs have triggered much interest among vehicle manufacturers around the world
for cars, trucks, sports utility vehicles (SUVs), vans, buses, trains, ships, and airplanes to use fuel-cellbased propulsion systems. The full spectrum with comparison to the weight of vehicles and the
distance each vehicle would travel per day is shown on Figure 3-10. Note that for most surface
transportation vehicles, the fuel cells are part of a battery-based hybrid system to take advantage of
the regenerative braking and to provide enough power for acceleration.

Figure 3-10 shows that the most attractive and amenable technology is the PEM fuel cell, and PEM
fuel cells are the default option for Hydrail for the RER system, since marine and rail applications have
similar heavy-duty cycles and hours of operation.
PEM fuel cells closely resemble PEM electrolyzers operated in the reverse direction. Rather than using
electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, the PEM fuel cell is fed hydrogen to the anode and
oxygen (as air) to the cathode to produce water and electricity. A catalyst—usually platinum—
dissociates molecular hydrogen into two protons and electrons; and the PEM membrane, which is the
key technology in all PEM devices, allows the passage of H+ but prevents the passage of electrons,
which must then rejoin the protons through an external electrical circuit, providing the electrical
output of the fuel cell. At the cathode, the protons and electrons are reunited in reaction with an
oxygen molecule, forming water. PEM cells operate in the region of 60 to 80°C, with pressure ranging
from 1 to 3 MPa.
Where hydrogen is the fuel, electricity, water, and heat are the only products of the chemical reactions
that occur in different segments of the fuel cell. HFCs can have almost twice the efficiency of
traditional combustion technologies32. For instance, a conventional fossil fuel power plant typically
generates electricity at 33-35 percent efficiency. Fuel cells can generate electricity at an efficiency
level of up to 60 percent. In addition, fuel cells also operate quietly and have fewer moving parts
compared to conventional methods of producing electricity. They are also extremely compact, far
smaller than a classical internal combustion engine.
Canadian companies lead the world in bringing PEM technology to maturity. The Hydrogen Council
has recently published their overview of the roles best suited to BEVs and FCEVs, shown on
Figure 3-10.
The attributes of HFCs have triggered much interest among vehicle manufacturers around the world
for cars, trucks, SUVs, vans, buses, trains, ships, and airplanes to use fuel-cell-based propulsion
systems. The full spectrum with comparison to the weight of vehicles and the distance each vehicle
would travel per day is shown on Figure 3-10. Note that for most surface transportation vehicles, the
fuel cells are part of a battery-based hybrid system to take advantage of the regenerative braking and
to provide enough power for acceleration.
Canadian fuel cells dominate in markets worldwide for transportation and stationary applications.
Bringing the technology to the point of commercialization has had to address cost, scalability,
endurance, and resistance to freezing. Scalability and operation in Canadian winter cold have been
resolved. Endurance is now more than 30 000 hours and continues to accumulate in real-time. On
cost, Ballard claims they have achieved a 65 percent reduction in 6 years, and costs continue to fall
(see Section 4.2.2.2).
Both for fuel cells and electrolyzers, PEM technology has come of age and is fully capable of scale-up.
Hydrogenics’ fuel cells are already operating in the world’s first hydrogen-fuelled railway application
in Germany, Alstom’s iLint. From one recent order alone, Ballard is supplying fuel cells for over
300 buses in China33. In June 2017, Hydrogenics is signing a purchase agreement to supply 1,000 bus
units over the next 2 to 3 years with a different Chinese company. An announcement this October by

the Viking Cruise line that their next ocean-going ship will be powered exclusively by PEM cells
fuelled by hydrogen is on the same scale34 as the entire RER GO network. Even at the much lighter
scale of automobiles, Honda, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, and Toyota have begun commercial
production of fuel-cell-powered cars. On October 26, 2017, an HFC-powered tram went into
commercial operation in Tangshan, Hebei province, China. One year earlier, a hybrid tram system—
partly powered by HFCs but with part of the route supplied by 750 overhead DC power—began
operation in Qingdao, Shandong province.
On the reconversion of hydrogen to electricity, except for the cruise ship—which is not yet a reality—the
scale of power requirements for individual units on the RER GO network is significantly larger than
existing fuel cell deployments, so the capability to scale up PEM fuel cell technology is an important
consideration. At today’s scale of up to 200 kW per fuel cell module, around 20 to 30 such modules
will be needed to power an RER locomotive. However, PEM fuel cell technology is intrinsically
modular, and assembling modules either in parallel or in series is straightforward. EMUs will require
fewer modules and are closer to the Alstom iLint, which combines four Hydrogenics modules.

3.2.8.2 Reliability, Maintainability, and Safety
Reliability of fuel cells has enabled the growth of fuel cell applications in various transportation
vehicles across the world, including that three major automobile manufacturers have started selling
fuel-cell-powered vehicles to customers. There is proven revenue service operation of fuel-cellpowered transit buses beyond 25 000 hours of operation. Fuel cells have been operating in vehicles
across the world, with a combined revenue service operation of more than 11 million kilometres of
travel.
Maintenance and failure of fuel cells is unlike that for conventional vehicles: fuel cells very gradually
lose performance (rather than failing totally) and maintenance consists mainly of software download
to determine the state of individual cells. When a cell’s performance is no longer considered
adequate, it is rebuilt—at about 60 percent of the original cost—with a new membrane assembly.
Additional experience is garnered from stationary fuel cell applications in grid services, and from
combined heat and power (CHP) applications for backup or main power source for homes (mostly in
Japan). The advantage of fuel cells, unlike other engines that have moving parts, is the high reliability
and low maintenance, irrespective of where it is applied. They are modular, so a good fuel cell design
could be added or reduced, depending on the power profile needed for a given application –
transportation vehicle or other.
Any leaks or changes in flow rate of H2 in the system would shut down the operation of fuel cells, so
the battery system or a secondary fuel cell stack would provide the reliability for service. There are
sensors that would be placed near the fuel cells (from automobile fuel cell experience) and the tanks,
so that leaks detected would disrupt the supply right away to contain the risk. Additional information
on safety is provided in Appendix B.

Vehicle Power Management – Battery Technology

Beside the fuel cells, power-intensive applications, such as trains, buses, and trucks, use a hybrid
propulsion system, where a battery system delivers the peak power required when leaving the
platform and also regeneratively captures power from the brakes while decelerating.

3.2.9.1 Design and Functionality
For vehicle propulsion, battery weight is a crucial consideration, so battery development explored the
use of the lightest metal, lithium, with cells powered by movement of lithium ions. The key
breakthroughs with this technology occurred in 1979 with use of lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) as the
source of lithium ions for the charging phase; and in 1980, of porous carbon as the repository for
these ions. 35
Rapid development since then has firmly established lithium ion batteries (LIBs) in many markets and
as the technology for applications in electric transportation. As annual production of LIBs moved into
billions, the price has fallen sharply, even as the technology has improved rapidly both in volume and
weight charge density. LIBs are the accepted choice for batteries over a wide range of applications,
including stand-alone and hybrid vehicle systems.
A detailed description of LIB technology is beyond the capacity of this review but it is an area of
intense development. There are at least six major categories of LIBs distinguished by the composition
of cathodes36:
1. Lithium Cobalt Oxide (LCO), LiCoO2
2. Lithium Manganese Oxide (LMO), LiMn2O4
3. Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide (NMC), LiNixMnyCo1-x-yO2
4. Lithium Nickel Cobalt Aluminum Oxide (NCA), LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2
5. Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP), LiFePO4 (LFP)
6. Lithium Titanate: Li4Ti5O12 (LTO)
NMC types are the fastest growing category37, excelling in energy content, power, cycle life and
thermal stability according to Blomgren. Even within the NMC category, there is diversity of cathode
design. Elsewhere in LIBs, competing designs of anode (basically carbon, but with many
morphologies) and electrolyte (an organic carbonate such as dimethyl carbonate [CH3O]) continue to
be subject to intense research. With worldwide demand projected by Pillot to grow by a factor of over
2.5 between 2017 and 2025, developments will continue to drive down price, improve capacity and
stability even as prices are projected to continue to fall on a weight basis. Blomgren quotes current
prices for LIBs as low as US$190 per kWh and the objective of BEV car makers at $125 US/kWh.
A comparison of six aspects of these six Li-ion battery types is provided on Figure 3-11. These aspects
are: specific energy; specific power; safety; performance; lifespan; and cost.

lifetime is extended if it is never charged to full voltage and kept cool (less than 40°C)39.

All batteries gradually lose capacity with cycling, a major constraint on their deployment in heavy-duty
applications. The opportunity for improvement is huge, and there has been dramatic progress. In
November 2016, Yasunaga, a Japanese battery manufacturer claimed that they had developed a
special positive electrode surface treatment which would allow the battery to have more than twelve
times the cycle life of conventional lithium-ion batteries. Batteries were tested to 60,000 to
102,400 cycles before falling to 70 percent of the original new capacity, compared to the
conventional battery that would only do 5,000 to 6,000 cycles. 40
Lifetime extension over cycles is immensely important to our Hydrail application because the battery
is capturing power whenever the train stops, and releasing that power to provide acceleration boost
whenever it restarts. So, while a BEV might reasonably operate for a day on one or two charges, a
Hydrail commuter train could experience perhaps 100 battery charge-discharge cycles per day.
To sum up, the current situation is that for almost all fuel-cell vehicle applications, fuel cells deployed
as a hybrid combination with LIBs can already accommodate loss of battery capacity with time. While
formidable difficulties exist in the application of battery technology alone due to the exacting
conditions of commuter or freight rail—all of weight, bulk, charge rate, and cost, separately—battery
technology is evolving rapidly. Yasunaga’s technology is just one example with considerable potential
to enhance fuel cell hybrids, including Hydrail, by simplifying their design and reducing the frequency
for battery replacement. Continuing improvement can be anticipated.
The early deployment of LIBs had problems, notably two well-publicized incidents with LIBs catching
fire occurred on a Boeing 787 aircraft, an early instance of LIB use in heavier duties. The U.S. National
Transport Safety Board concluded that a manufacturing defect in a single cell had led to its shortcircuiting, leading to a thermal runaway as overheating spread to neighbouring cells41. The resolution
in response to these incidents has been to ensure adequate separation of individual cells to ensure
sufficient cooling and avoid a cascade of cells failing. Two newer applications of LIBs in e-cigarettes
and in hover boards have led to small fires and some injuries. A U.S. Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) review42 of these incidents concluded that their use in e-cigarettes was inappropriate.
Notwithstanding design overreach in miniaturizing Samsung’s Galaxy 7 phone, with proper design
LIBs are now deployed without problems in billions of devices ranging in scale from phones to
massive stationary electricity storage banks. Additional information on safety is provided in

3.2.10 Vehicle Hydrogen Management – Storage Tanks
The hydrogen storage tanks onboard mobile vehicles are specially designed to be used for onboard
fuelling of fuel cell systems. The current design standards are derived from other modes of transport
such as buses which are adapted in Coradia iLint where 35 MPa tanks typically used in buses were
used for light-rail application.

3.2.10.1 Design and Functionality
As discussed earlier in Section 3.2.5, hydrogen could be stored in either gaseous form or in liquid
form. However, the fuel cells onboard the rail vehicle can only operate using gaseous hydrogen, so
when storing liquid hydrogen onboard, a high-pressure gaseous buffer tank needs to be included.
There is usually only one large liquid hydrogen tank that would be used onboard with additional
equipment to convert liquid to gaseous hydrogen.
If high-pressure or CGH2 is chosen for storage onboard, then Type IV tanks at 70 MPa (as shown in
Figure 3-12) are the current commercial option available. This would help conserve space onboard to
provide the required range of revenue service per day without a refill during the daytime (or during
regular service).
FIGURE 3-12 HIGH-PRESSURE TYPE IV HYDROGEN STORAGE TANKS USED IN CARS43

The storage tanks onboard the rail vehicle would be similar to that shown in Figure 3-12 for cars,
smaller and more in numbers to accommodate the high-pressure required and to make use of any
available space onboard the vehicle. The electrical connection indicated in Figure 3-12 is for
controlling the valves and pressure regulators and enable power to the sensors. These would also be
different for the rail vehicle, as there would be more tanks, so there would be an array of sensors,
valves, and regulators to be monitored and controlled.

3.2.10.2 Reliability, Maintainability and Safety
The RAMS for onboard storage tanks are more significant than the storage solutions for the fixed
infrastructure of the Hydrail System. As these tanks are travelling with passengers across an urban
area. Although no RAMS is available for such tanks on a rail application with passengers, there is
enough experience for onboard storage tanks from buses and in private vehicles such as cars.
By design, once these tanks are mounted into the vehicle as per codes and standards, there are no
moving parts except for the valves and regulators which have been proven in the field for RAMS. The
tanks would hold pressure up to 5,000 refills44 before it needs replacing. If each tank is filled only
once a day, then this translates to about 13.5 years of lifetime. The tank structure and the carbon fibrereinforced plastic winding method45 used to make these tanks have reliability over long-periods of
time and operate safely.
In terms of operational RAMS on vehicles with similar tanks, there are two examples cited here for
support. One is that more than one Toyota Mirai – the fuel cell powered car with tanks similar to the
one being considered for the Hydrail vehicles, has been successfully used by a taxi company in
London, England by operating without any issues (or fault-free service) for 50,000 miles46. The other
one is from the fuel cell powered bus operators in the US. The charts in Figure 3-13 shows the reasons
for unavailability of fuel cell powered buses from four transit agencies in the US.

Except for OCTA AFCB in Figure 3-13, the other transit agencies had very minimal impact from the
hydrogen propulsion system. From the same literature, none of this unavailability was reported due to
storage tanks onboard these buses.
The safety aspects of these tanks are very similar to any pressure vessels or tanks being used to store
hydrogen as discussed earlier in Section 3.2.7. The fatigue acceleration that could potentially arise
from the vibration that occurs onboard the rail vehicle should be addressed through engineered
damping. For gaseous tanks, leaks from rupture of tanks through mechanical force or piercing during
an accident or regular maintenance is possible. These are easily identifiable from sensors and the
tanks could be isolated for replacement. The Type IV tanks have undergone enormous testing and
safety regulations that addresses things like fire, explosion and other hazards near these tanks, which
are very well summarized elsewhere48. For liquid hydrogen tanks, loss of cryo-insulation could result
in sudden boil-off of hydrogen which would be vented through the pressure relief valves included in
the tank design. Additional information on safety is provided in Appendix B.

3.2.11 Potential Competing Technologies
3.2.11.1 Power exclusively from batteries
Battery technology is an area of intense research and development with DOE targeting a price of
$125/kWh for 202049 and GM projecting $100/kWh by 2021. When comparing the cost of fuel cells
and batteries, note the difference in units (kW versus kWh). Further note that, while a fuel cell can
deliver its rated power, an LIB battery must operate over at most 15-25 percent of its nominal capacity
if it is to avoid excessive reduction in lifetime. Effectively, this at least quadruples the size and cost of
batteries.
Consider the case of train that would consume 500 kg/d of hydrogen using fuel cells. At 50 percent
efficiency for the fuel cells, it will deliver 8.5 MWh from 700 kW of fuel cells. Cost of fuel cells at
1000 $/kW would be $700,000. The battery equivalent, using 25 percent of its nominal capacity and
$100/kWh, is $3 400 000. This is using projected costs for batteries and pessimistic costs for fuel cells.
If one uses projected future costs for fuel cells, the fuel cell cost could drop well below $100,000.
The weight of LIBs is another consideration. Using a reasonable 200 Wh/kg for LIB weight, the weight
of batteries for this typical example would be 170 tonnes, an additional 20 percent weight to the total
(860 tonnes) of an entire fuel-cell powered train. and allowing 50 percent efficiency for conversion of
hydrogen into electricity in a PEM cell, (High-pressure carbon-fibre-reinforced tanks have one-quarter
of the weight50 of batteries containing the same electrical capacity or one-sixteenth of the batteries’
effective electrical capacity.)
Particularly since fuel cell technology is still also in a phase of technological improvement, one would
conclude that the superiority of Hydrail is under no obvious threat from battery technology. Indeed,
when one compares the economics of hydrogen-burning fuel cells using electrolytic hydrogen with
those of batteries, it becomes clear why so many of the automobile companies are marketing fuel-cell
powered light vehicles. If hydrogen-fuelling was anywhere close to being as widely availability as
electricity, hydrogen-burning fuel cells would likely be pre-eminent for all vehicles. Of course, this is

not an issue for Hydrail where providing fuelling points for RER’s Hydrail is merely a small part of the
system design.

3.2.11.2 Continuous Power from Alternatives to Catenaries
In 2011, several leading rail manufacturers were developing such systems51. Ansaldo has its
TramWave System with a buried version of overhead catenaries using a segmented ferromagnetic
belt in a conduit that becomes “live” only in the presence of the rail vehicle. Alstom’s APS system is
similar. Both of these systems are designed for trams and have problems with snow and ice—as
traditional catenary systems do. Bombardier’s Primove System claims to avoid the problem of snow
and ice with a contactless approach using inductive coupling. All of these are for light-rail application
and currently in the prototype demonstration phase. Primove-powered buses have, however, passed
500 000 km of service operation in five European cities52. Alstom’s APS trams have amassed over
20 million kilometres in five French cities53.
A recent thesis study by Thomas Navadi54 concludes that inductive transfer of electricity to a moving
vehicle was 60 to 70 percent more expensive than systems with catenaries and only 35 percent
energy efficient. While a rail system would probably have more efficient transfer—since non-alignment
between the power source and the collector is considered by Navadi to be a large part of road
vehicles’ inefficiency, efficiency of energy use is an important consideration given that these
technologies do not time-shift electricity demand. Navadi’s estimate of high capital cost is currently
another major disadvantage of these non-catenary systems. They have not been applied to heavyduty applications.

3.2.11.3 Power from Batteries with Frequent Recharge
Recognition of the limitations of batteries for extended operation has led to research on ways to
recharge batteries rapidly while a vehicle is briefly stopped or even while it is moving. The ways that
this could be accomplished are the same as those used to transfer power continuously with the
systems described in the previous section. Introducing batteries seems an unnecessary complication
that would add weight, have limited battery life, and have to deal with heat dissipation during rapid
charging of a battery pack.

Where Hydrogen Can be Used

3.3.1

Overview

There are various applications for hydrogen beyond massive industrial consumption, some of which
are summarized on Figure 3-14 The market maturity of these applications is indicated in three
different colours on the figure, as Demonstration, Commercialization, and Established, based on our
literature review.
FIGURE 3-14 HYDROGEN APPLICATIONS IN FOUR PREVALENT MARKET AREAS

At a gathering pace over the last century, hydrogen has been used for numerous industrial
applications: in petroleum refining, to produce ammonia fertilizers; in steel making to do what; and
many others. For refining in the petroleum industry, it is used to remove sulphur and nitrogen from
crude feedstocks; it is also used to produce more volatile products, such as gasoline and kerosene by
direct addition (hydrofining) and breaking of molecules (hydrocracking). Hydrogen is increasingly
used in place of coal or coke to remove the oxygen from iron ore and provide a passive atmosphere
during steel making.

These large-scale industrial uses have established hydrogen as a bulk commodity. Now new
applications are emerging, mainly in stationary applications but, increasingly, in transportation.

3.3.1.1 Grid Stabilization and Energy Storage
Today, hydrogen electrolyzers and fuel cells provide grid stabilization and energy storage services in
many countries, especially in Europe. While hydrogen technologies are currently deployed for only
about 1 percent of the energy storage services55 compared with other bulk and seasonal storage
technologies, its importance is expected to grow by using long-term storage in underground caverns
in the same way that natural gas is currently stockpiled to meet the demands of winter usage.
In addition, Toronto Hydro is currently testing a compressed gas scheme using the pressure of water
to contain the pressure of air in bladders underwater off Toronto Island.56

3.3.1.2 Backup Power
Use of HFCs for backup power or for regular power has become a norm to support
telecommunication towers spread across the country in various nations, including Canada, the United
States (U.S.), and others. Countries like Japan have been using fuel cells as backup power for homes
and residential buildings, as fuel cells provide the benefit of CHP.
The deployment of fuel cells for backup power has been growing with help from large organizations
investing in the technology. This includes the U.S. Federal Government, through American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funding, which saw growth from 2009 to 2012, as shown on Figure 3-15.

3.3.1.3 Automotive Vehicles
The Toyota Mirai is a proton-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel-cell-powered vehicle already
commercially available. It uses two carbon-fibre-reinforced composite tanks operating at 700 bar for a
range of approximately 550 kilometres (km). It takes 3 minutes to fill the tank. Like Toyota’s Prius
model, the Mirai uses the same nickel-metal-hydride (NiMH) battery for its hybridization, recapturing
braking energy and augmenting the fuel cell stack’s power output during acceleration. Maximum fuel
cell stack output is 114 kilowatts (kW).
Toyota noted that their FCV development started in 1992, with the fuel cell hybrid vehicle (FCHV),
which was first leased in 2002. Subsequently, three big technical issues were addressed over several
years:
1. The cruising range was increased to more than 500 km from 5 kilograms (kg) of hydrogen storage.
2. Cold start was demonstrated in a field test at Yellowknife, Northwest Territories (NWT) to −30 °C.
3. Refuelling time was lowered to about 3 minutes.
In addition, fuel stack density was increased from 1.4 kilowatts per litre (kW/L) in 2008 to 3.1 kW/L
in 2017.
Toyota continues with further developments of the fuel cell to lower cost; notably, by reducing the
platinum loading at both cathode and anode. Some of the deployment numbers are provided in
Table 3-2 for cars and other vehicle types.

Initially only in Japan, in 2017, Toyota launched a fuel-cell-powered bus adapting the Mirai
architecture with 2 of the Mirai’s fuel cell stacks and 10 of its hydrogen tanks, which provide
considerable range. Indicating a significant commitment to fostering HFC development, Toyota is
offering royalty-free use of their related suite of patents until the end of 2020.
Both the Honda fuel-cell-powered Clarity and Hyundai’s fuel-cell-powered Tucson are only available
in Southern California, where there are enough hydrogen fuelling stations. Their specifications are
broadly comparable to Toyota’s Mirai.
Fuel cells for vehicle propulsion on road vehicles, such as cars and sports utility vehicles (SUVs), are
growing rapidly in recent years, as indicated on Figure 3-16.

3.3.1.4 Material Handling Vehicles
In Balzac, Alberta, Walmart’s new perishable distribution centre relies entirely on PEM-fuel-cellpowered forklifts and palette trucks61. Walmart chose this technology after 18,000 hours of field
testing.
Amazon is spending US$70 million to replace its forklift batteries in 11 warehouses with HFCs62.
In contrast to batteries of any type, the fuel cells in this near continuous application are expected to
operate for 10 years. This is a new enough application that the PEM fuel cell lifetime is a projection.
Nonetheless, the projection is an indication of confidence in the lifetime of PEM fuel cells that
manufacturers can now deliver; after their design life, they can be rebuilt. Some applications require
operation at low temperatures, and Walmart’s test operations were unimpaired down to -29°C.
The shipping industry (cargo ships, primarily) already uses fuel cells in various services63, including
propulsion, onboard power generation, and CHP. This highlights the scaling and duty flexibility of
various fuel cell types, including PEM fuel cells.

3.3.1.5 Public Transit
The public transit deployments of hydrogen-powered vehicles have begun through HFC-powered
buses, mostly. There are about 150 buses currently in operation around the world (as shown in
Table 3-2), and hundreds of buses are planned to be introduced by various transit companies in the
next few years as part of the decarbonization targets set by the governments in countries such as
China and members of the European Union (EU) to meet their commitments to the Paris Agreement
of the United Nations (UN) Framework Convention on Climate Change, Article 4.1964.
For buses, Ballard’s fuel cells have now passed 25,000 hours of operation without significant
maintenance in a small fleet of vehicles being operated by Transport for London in the United
Kingdom (UK). Deployed in 15 countries in the past 10 years, Ballard claims a cumulative
11 million km of operation in revenue service in a wide range of climatic conditions and duty cycles65.
The pace of deployment of fuel-cell-powered buses is accelerating rapidly. Bloomberg reported66
that in September 2016, Ballard began delivering the first of 330 fuel cell buses to two cities in
Guangdong province, Yunfu and Foshan. That order alone will quadruple the global fleet of
hydrogen-powered buses. Most recently, on June 8, 2017, Hydrogenics signed a Purchase and
License Agreement with Blue-G New Energy Science and Technology Corporation for 1,000 fuel cell
bus power modules67—presumably for 500 buses.

3.3.1.6 Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (European Union)
The Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (FCHJU) is a substantial organization launched in 2014
under the EU’s 6th Framework Programme for Research and continued under the EU Horizon 2020
Framework. The partners are committed to supporting the program until at least 2024. It is led by
companies representing the entire supply chain for fuel cell and hydrogen energy technologies. The three
members of the FCHJU are the European Commission, fuel cell and hydrogen industries represented
by Hydrogen Europe, and the research community represented by Hydrogen Europe Research.
To quote from their website68:
“This is a unique public private partnership supporting research, technological
development and demonstration (RTD) activities in fuel cell and hydrogen energy
technologies in Europe. Its aim is to accelerate the market introduction of these
technologies, realising their potential as an instrument in achieving a carbon-lean
energy system.”

Its stated objective is to:
“Overcoming barriers to deployment: There are still many technical and non-technical
barriers to overcome before fuel cell and hydrogen technology is widely commercially
available. A concentrated effort of all players is necessary, because the research
needed to develop the technologies is often so complex that no single company or
public research institution can perform it alone. Funding contributed by the partners
has ranged upward of €600,000 in each of the six-year Framework periods and is
currently over €200,00 per year.”
The FCHJU appreciates the case for deployment of hydrogen and fuel cells:
“Fuel cells, as an efficient conversion technology, and hydrogen, as a clean energy
carrier, have a great potential to contribute to addressing energy challenges facing
Europe. They will allow renewable energy technology to be applied to transport,
facilitate distributed power generation, and help Europe cope with the intermittent
character of renewables such as wind power.”
They also appreciate the need for support of ongoing development and for building hydrogen supply
infrastructure ahead of the demand that can only appear when fuelling is widely available.
With its massive combination of the funding of private industry backed by large, multiyear
government contributions from across the EU, substantial improvements in HFC technology will
continue to unfold, lowering the technology’s capital costs and, to a lesser degree, its operating costs.

Case Studies

3.3.2.1 BC Transit (Whistler, British Columbia)
BC Transit operated a 20-vehicle fleet of fuel-cell-powered buses for transit in the skiing and tourist
community of Whistler for 36 months between 2010 and 2013. The buses used Ballard’s PEM fuel cells and
were hybridized with lithium phosphate batteries69. The concept was to showcase fuel cell technology for
the 2010 Winter Olympics. The buses were well-accepted by the public, drivers, maintainers, and the local
community. The project was delivered on-time and on-budget. The buses travelled more than 4 million km
over their 4 years of operation, operating up to 22 hours per day in temperatures ranging from -20 to
+34.7°C. Over 590 tonnes of hydrogen were dispensed in over 23,000 fills without any safety incidents. An
average of 15.7 kg of hydrogen was used for each 100 km of travel, displacing 52.5 litres (L) of diesel fuel,
and avoiding emissions of almost 6,000 tonnes of CO2. There were no intrinsic problems with the fuel cells,
and all but two of the 22 fuel cell power packs exceeded 8,000 hours of operation.
Now, this was something of a pioneering deployment of fuel cells to power buses, and it proved to be
an excellent learning opportunity, which was carefully analyzed by the U.S. National Renewable
Energy Laboratory (NREL) for the Californian Air Resources Board70. This showed the need for welldirected integration of the various components (for example, integrating the fuel cell with its
compressed air supply, or adapting the suspension to a different distribution of weights). With the

69 Lithium phosphate batteries belong to the LIB family. They use lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) instead of the more usual lithium cobalt
oxide (LiCoO2) as the cathode material. LiPO4 gives longer life and faster charge and discharge rates, but a somewhat lower energy density
than LiCoO2.

wisdom of hindsight, it became clear that staff should have advanced training for different types of
maintenance, and that distinctively different spare parts needed to be stocked.

3.3.2.2 Independent Electricity System Operator Power-to-Gas
(Markham, Ontario)
Until about the middle of the 20th Century, “town gas” for heating was usually generated from coal.
Town gas was a mixture of about equal quantities of hydrogen and carbon monoxide (CO). It had the
serious disadvantage of CO’s toxicity and has, today, almost completely been displaced by natural gas.
However, hydrogen—the other component of town gas—is not toxic and is poised to re-enter the gasfor-heat application. In the middle of 2015, the IESO procured a 2-megawatt (MW) power-to-gas (PtG)
project to demonstrate the ability of hydrogen to provide grid services in Ontario71. The selected
respondents (Hydrogenics and Enbridge Gas) will produce hydrogen from the 2 MW of electricity from
the grid using the water electrolysis technology and then inject the gas into the natural gas pipeline
owned and operated by Enbridge Gas. The PtG facility located north of Toronto will start operating in
the next few months, providing the expected benefits to the grid by converting surplus electricity.

3.3.2.3 Canadian Tire Warehouse (Brampton, Ontario)
Forklifts are early adopters of fuel cell technology. Using internal combustion engines to power vehicles
in large, enclosed, populated spaces presents the challenge of providing adequate ventilation. Very
large, modern distribution centres rely on extensive use of forklifts, and Canadian Tire Corporation
(CTC) was a leader in turning to HFC to power their forklift fleet in their Brampton warehouse.
The traditional approach for forklifts has been to use a battery-electric drive using lead-acid batteries.
These have four disadvantages:
1. Recharging the batteries is slow, so the system relies on change-out at a recharge station. This is
slow and cumbersome.
2. Lead-acid batteries deliver a declining voltage as their charge level falls. This leads to a trend of
noticeably slowing performance during a shift.
3. The batteries are heavy.
4. Batteries need to be replaced every 2 to 3 years.
Rather than moving to newer types of batteries, the emerging consensus is to turn to HFCs. For their
Brampton, Ontario centre, CTC uses onsite alkaline fuel cells to produce their hydrogen with grid
electricity. The hydrogen then used in PEM fuel cells on the forklifts. The major advantages of the
system are fast refuelling and higher asset utilization.
The implementation of HFC forklifts at Brampton has been so successful that CTC is now equipping a
new distribution centre in Bolton, Ontario with them.

3.3.2.4 Walmart Canada Fuel Cell Forklift Fleet
Walmart’s entire fleet of material handling equipment (MHE) at the Walmart Perishable Distribution
Centre (PDC) in Alberta is now powered by HFCs72. Walmart decided to incorporate HFC forklifts and
palette trucks in the PDC facility after the successful 4-month trial of fuel cell forklifts at two distribution

centres. This trial achieved a 3.5 percent increase in productivity over comparable battery-powered
forklifts.
The forklifts are using hydrogen produced by Air Liquide from 98 percent hydro power, and fuel cells
from Ballard. The Canadian Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Association predicted that this technology is
delivering a $2 million reduction in operating costs (projected over a 7-year period) and contributing
to a reduction of 530 tonnes of CO2 per year.

3.3.2.5 Raglan Mine Energy Storage (Nunavik, Québec)
Glencore’s Raglan Mine is located in the extreme northern part of Québec in the Nunavik region. As
well as being an exceptionally low-cost producer of nickel, the mine coproduces copper and cobalt,
and some precious metals. The reserve will support indefinite operation.
Because of its remote, harsh, far-northern location, the mine is aiming for as much self-sufficiency as
possible. One approach they have adopted is to harness wind energy, an abundant but unpredictable
resource. Tugliq Energy Company was engaged to build and operate a system based on a 3-MW
wind turbine to provide primary production of electricity, and then convert that to hydrogen by
electrolysis. The 200-kW PEM fuel cell assembly can supply up to 20 hours of the mine’s electrical
load. Potentially, hydrogen could also be supplied to fuel underground mine vehicles.
In 3 years of operation (since August 2014), Tugliq has avoided consumption of 6 million litres of
diesel fuel. Even allowing for very good wind availability in the Arctic, this is indicative of the system
achieving a high-capacity factor over what is a comparatively short operating lifetime to date73.
Unlike batteries, modern fuel cells are insensitive to low-temperature operation: Hydrogenics firstever fuel cell was deployed in Antarctica. So, while a BEV struggles to meet the heating demands of
even southern Canada in winter, the integrated system at Raglan with its fuel cell stack easily
accommodates winter temperatures that average around -20°C for 4 months of the year and
delivered 97.8 percent availability in its first 20 months of operation, including two winters.
Having demonstrated reliability and robustness to meet the risk profile of mining companies like
Glencore, their experience as educated buyers and operators provides the assurance for applicability
to community-sized deployments in remote areas of Canada’s North, as well as in less harsh
environments.

3.3.2.6 Fuel Cells used in Maritime Applications
In 2017, the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Fuel Cell Technologies Office in the Office of Energy
Efficiency & Renewable Energy released a report74 detailing the results of a maritime fuel cell
generator project. This project was intended to:


Demonstrate an HFC power generator for marine applications



Verify increased energy efficiency at part loads and reduced emissions



Identify areas requiring further research

A 100-kW generator with 72 kg of hydrogen storage was designed and built by Hydrogenics, with
safety and regulatory reviews by the Hydrogen Safety Panel, U.S. Coast Guard, and the American
Bureau of Shipping. The project showed that it is possible to increase energy efficiency by up to
30 percent at part load, and reduce emissions to zero through the use of HFCs.
In a 2016 review paper, van Briet et al.75 note that, because fuel cells are modular in nature and the
intrinsic performance of a single cell is not different from a large stack, ships can benefit from
distributing units throughout the ship without a penalty of increased fuel consumption, reducing
electricity transport losses, and improving redundancy. Furthermore, fuel cell systems are noted for
being well-suited to fluctuating shipboard demands, since they have good part load characteristics.
Very recently, the luxury cruise line Viking announced that their next ocean-going ship will depend
entirely on HFCs for its 62.4-MW power system. Unlike the system envisaged by van Briet et al., which
would produce hydrogen onboard by reforming a liquid fuel, Viking intends to supply their ships with
LH2.

3.3.2.7 Qingdao Light Rail Transit (Shandong Province, China)
In 2015, Ballard signed a joint development and supply agreement to develop and commercialize a
fuel cell engine specifically designed for integration into low floor trams manufactured by CRRC
Qingdao Sifang Company, Ltd. (CRRC Sifang), a Chinese rolling stock manufacturer. The agreements
included 2016 delivery of 10 customized FCvelocity modules, and the agreements have an initial
value expected to be approximately $6 million.
For this customer’s requirements, Ballard developed a new prototype configuration of their FCvelocity
fuel cell module to deliver 200 kW of net power for use in powering trams in urban deployments.
Ballard shipped five of these 200-kW modules to CRRC Sifang in 2017, and these will be used in the
world’s first fully commercial service of fuel-cell-powered trams in Foshan starting in 2018. This
hydrogen-powered tram will run in Foshan in southeastern China. A 17.4-km track will be built in two
phases at 760 million yuan ($140.0 million) with 20 stations. Construction began in February 201776.
This is an Asian first, as China will deliver new hydrogen light rail service in the region. A
demonstration model of the trains was first rolled out in Qingdao in 2015.

3.3.2.8 Canadian Fuel-Cell Buses in China
In 2015 June, Ballard received an order for fuel cell modules for 33 buses in the cities of Yunfu,
(Guangdong) and Rugao (Jiangsu), and 3 months later, for another 300 buses. This has just been the
beginning and Zhongshan and Broad-Ocean Motor Co., Ballard’s biggest shareholder, who are now
building three factories in China to make fuel-cell modules for vehicles using Ballard technology.
Hydrogenics is also active in China, with an order to supply 1,000 fuel cell units for buses to Blue-G.
Beside being a potentially huge market, the Chinese commitment to reducing GHG emissions is
reinforced by the need to reduce local air pollution. As with many other new technologies, one can

expect China to master fuel-cell-bus technology rapidly and then to deploy their experience on the
export market. In choosing to partner with local companies, the technically advanced Canadian fuelcell manufacturers appear to have recognized the value of this collaboration for entry to a major,
global vehicle market.

3.3.2.9 Vattenfall Fuelling Station (Germany)
In partnership with Shell, the Vattenfall electricity company has operated a fuelling station in Hamburg
since 2012 to supply cars and buses with 350-bar hydrogen (subsequently augmented with 700-bar
capability). Half of its hydrogen is produced onsite by electrolysis; the remainder is shipped in77. So
far, the station’s customers are largely city buses. While car refuelling service is available, there has
been little implementation in Germany so far. However, the experience in southern California shows
that HFC car ownership expands rapidly after a reasonably dense network of fuelling points is
available, and the German situation is about to change with H2 Mobility planning to open 400 stations
there by 2023.

3.3.2.10 Alstom Coradia iLint (Lower Saxony, Germany)
Germany’s first hydrogen-fuelled commuter train, with PEM cells from Hydrogenics, has been
undergoing track trials since early in 2017 and will enter service before the end of the year. Alstom’s
Coradia iLint is based on a diesel Coradia Lint antecedent, with the iLint replacing the diesel traction
with fuel cell technology. It has a sustainable train performance, matching that of regular regional
trains, running at 140 kilometres per hour (kph), with a 600 to 800 km per tankful autonomy, and
accommodating up to 300 passengers. Like almost all fuel-cell-powered vehicles, it is a hybrid, using
LIBs for regenerative braking and initial acceleration.
Quoting from a New York Times story78,
“…about 40 percent of Germany’s rail network is not electrified. And Alstom executives
say that it would be cheaper to replace the diesel-powered trains with hydrogen
vehicles than to string electric lines along the tracks.
“Alstom says it has preliminary orders for 50 to 60 trains from German regional
authorities. A commuter line like this one looks well-suited to hydrogen. The company
can build a fuel supply system in a safe place like a rail yard of its choosing.”

the two systems.

4.1

Hydrail System Design

Based on the above this section identifies the technology choices that are available for the
configuration of the Hydrail System.
It does this by assessing the hydrogen technology options identified in Part 3 to the required
functionality of the Hydrail System at the level of its sub-systems.
The output of this section are the parameters that are included in the Operational Simulation model
described in section 4.2.
The Hydrail System design entails the integration of various hydrogen component subsystems with
various technologies that are existing in the market for both off-the-shelf purchase or as custom order
items. The Hydrail System envisioned for the GO network would comprise the seven subsystems
shown on Figure 4-1. It includes, from the GO service end:
1. Hydrogen vehicle
2. Hydrogen dispensing
3. Hydrogen refuelling
4. Hydrogen distribution
5. Hydrogen storage
6. Hydrogen production
7. Electricity supply

The components that would form the integrated hydrogen rail system in Ontario are:
FIGURE 4-1 HYDRAIL SYSTEM COMPONENTS

With the Hydrail System the subsystems of the vehicle, dispensing, refuelling, distribution, and
storage share common characteristics with the current diesel-based system. However, unlike diesel,
the scope of the Hydrail System includes the process of fuel production. A benefit of this is that the
fuel price should be less variable than diesel as it brings into the control of Metrolinx one of the
market externalities that currently affects it.

4.1.1

Key Components Overview

Each of the subsystems within Hydrail, from hydrogen production to dispensing, is modular, to meet
the evolving requirements of GO rail corridor. For example, the hydrogen storage can be built to
meet the initial needs of an enhanced RER service on a given corridor and could then be expanded as
the train service on the corridor grows over the future years. In relation to the hydrogen production
subsystem, there are two options for where these can be located:
1. At a distance from the GO network
2. Onsite: located fairly close to refuelling facilities
The first option could be a single, central facility or several locations convenient to refuelling points.
The second option would be at as many locations as there are refuelling points. Due to modularity,
dispersing electrolysis has little effect on total costs for either option.
The decision as to which of the above options is preferred, will depend on the specific nature of each
corridor and the decision criteria will include: availability and cost of land, electrical grid accessibility
and any zoning restrictions.

4.1.2

Electricity Supply Subsystem

The end-to-end Hydrail System begins with the supply of electricity to make hydrogen through water
electrolysis technology. The Ontario electrical grid (as discussed in Section 3.2.3.1) is predominantly
carbon-free with various supply options, as shown on Figure 4-2, from nuclear, to hydro-electric, to
solar, and wind, with natural gas providing the peak-demand service. So, hydrogen production using
surplus electricity results in over 80 percent GHG reduction for the GO system.
The grid is primarily made up of the following components categorized as generators, consumers,
and grid services (as implied in the layout on Figure 4-2). Depending on the price of electricity, as well
as capacity for hydrogen storage, electricity is drawn from the Ontario grid and converted into
hydrogen by water electrolysis, mainly at times of grid oversupply and low value for electricity in the
market. Occasionally, when the hydrogen capacity is too low in the fuel inventory, electricity at higher
prices is used—governed by the imperative of always meeting the GO network’s requirement for
hydrogen.

Hydrogen Production Subsystem

The key elements of the water electrolyzer-based hydrogen production subsystem are shown on

of four primary components:

3. Cooling and drying systems
4. Power electronics (or power management)
The components except the stack are jointly called the balance of plant (BOP). The stack is at the core

The inefficiency in the electrolyzers would result in heat generation from the stacks, so they have to be
cooled to maintain the operating temperature at about 60 degrees Celsius (ºC). Usually, they are air
cooled for smaller stacks, but for larger stack sizes or a combination of many smaller stacks, cooling
water circulation with significant amount of cooling water would be required. To minimize the water
usage, a cooling tower might be required. The current assessment estimated the amount of makeup
water that would be needed by the cooling tower and is included in the assessment of the total
amount of water required by the Hydrail System.

4.1.3.1 Operational Characteristics: Current Density and Cheap Electricity
The current density is a flexible operational parameter inherent to water electrolyzers that supports
the operating economics of hydrogen generation for the Hydrail System. The performance curve in
Figure 4-4 suggests the range of flexibility available to take advantage of the lower price of electricity
at certain periods in a day within the Ontario electrical grid.
The curve in Figure 4-4 shows the power consumption to produce one cubic metre of hydrogen by
Hydrogenic’s PEM electrolyzers. Higher current density is less energy-efficient but concentrating
hydrogen production at times of low electricity price can still be cost-efficient and using higher
current densities at times of low electricity cost also reduces the capital cost of electrolysis cells.

The higher electrolyzer efficiency of PEM would have up to 15 percent reduction in operating cost
compared to the alkaline electrolyzers. Until the efficiency of the alkaline electrolyzer is improved to
match that of the PEM, for Hydrail-type systems, the PEM looks more attractive from an operating cost
perspective. The impact from the larger stack size, longer lifetime, and economy of scale is yet to be
assessed for the two types of electrolyzers. The larger stack size, for example, when using alkaline
electrolyzers, is attractive for central or combined production scenarios. There could be one
production facility for a combination of more than one or two GO rail corridors, requiring a larger
number of electrolyzers in one given location, so the alkaline electrolyzers could prove economic
benefits based on the initial and replacement capital costs.
In terms of making a recommendation on these two technologies for use within the Hydrail System, it
is too early, as there are unknowns (listed as follows) that make the decision difficult at this time:


The number of central or combined locations for production



If it is onsite production, the installed capacity requirement



Transition plan for the Hydrail System – all corridors or one at a time, as this would also impact the
decision on large-scale central production or small-scale onsite production



Operational characteristics of the individual production centres at each location

4.1.4

Hydrogen Storage Subsystem

The hydrogen storage subsystem is expected to be part of the production system or sited right next
to the production system, as a temporary or transition storage system to manage the large volume of
gas that would be needed by the Hydrail System. The key equipment within the hydrogen storage
subsystem is shown on Figure 4-5 for both liquid and gas phases. The common equipment for either
phase includes:


Compressor



Flow controllers



Regulators



Sensors



Tanks



Control system that distributes and manages electrical power



Control signals to all the relevant equipment within the storage system

The liquid phase, in addition, would have a refrigeration plant as part of the liquefaction plant to cool
the hydrogen to about -253°C; at which point, hydrogen becomes a liquid.
The gaseous hydrogen produced by the electrolyzers needs to be stored until it is required by the
refuelling system. The amount of storage is dictated by the amount of electrolysis described earlier, to
take advantage of the lower market price of electricity in the Ontario grid.

4.1.4.1 Gaseous and Liquid Phases of Hydrogen
Liquid phase storage tanks are much different from gas phase storage tanks, and fewer liquid tanks
would be required for the same amount of gas. The choice between liquid phase and gaseous phase
storage is based on several factors, although from our assessment, the liquid phase one does not
seem viable for the proposed Hydrail System. The suppliers of merchant hydrogen are attuned to
moving relatively small quantities of hydrogen as liquid (LH2). However, on the larger scale of the
proposed RER Hydrail System, there are substantial reasons for operating purely with CGH2, as
follows:


Energy Input: To include LH2 as part of the Hydrail System, energy usage is increased by
10 percent, and energy cost is increased by 20 percent because—unlike electrolysis—the
liquefaction process is not readily interruptible and cannot focus on periods of low-cost grid
values.



Capital Cost: The cost of a liquefaction plant for the entire RER system is estimated at $160 million
This adds complexity to the supply chain and, with no evident substantial cost offsets, this is an
additional cost.



Distribution Cost: Centralization of LH2 would be preferred on economic grounds—the capital cost
of liquefaction plants does not scale well. That leads to a need for extensive distribution, and LH2
precludes gas distribution by pipeline. Admittedly, pipeline distribution may encounter some
public resistance, but is likely to be practicable. Trucking is cheaper with liquid than with gas, but
either, for almost any distance, is much more expensive than pipelining.



Problems with Solid Oxygen: Hydrogen needs extreme purification from oxygen before
liquefaction. Purification can be arranged, but it is a particularly significant issue with
electrolytically produced H2 with its inevitable initial oxygen content. This is much less of an issue
with steam-methane reforming (SMR) H2, which is generally oxygen-free. Traces of oxygen present
in hydrogen liquefaction can accumulate in lines and tanks as solid oxygen, and can lead to violent
detonation.



Accident Scenarios: In the event of a spill, LH2 does not disperse nearly as readily or quickly as H2
gas. This increases fire risks.



Hydrogen Losses: Design can curtail but will not eliminate H2 losses from boil-off within the entire
production and consumption chain, thereby increasing the operating cost.



Extra Handling Risk: While fast vehicle-fill times could be easier with LH2, it is considered more
prone to accidents than fuelling using the well-established technology for fuelling with CGH2.
Overall, LH2 is a much less familiar fuel than CGH2.

4.1.4.2 Storage Tank Characteristics
There is significant difference in the storage tank design in terms of materials, construction, and
capital costs. The design is primarily driven by the storage pressure requirements. For the transition
storage system, lower-pressure storage would save significant capital costs, as the volume of storage
is at least three times larger than the upcoming refuelling storage system. There are at least two
distinct types of tanks worth comparing (as summarized in Table 4-5) to provide a basis for the storage
system design.

Hydrogen Distribution Subsystem

The hydrogen distribution subsystem connects the storage system with the refuelling system, and it
differs based on gas or liquid phases of hydrogen. For the gas phase, distribution can be by either
pipeline or trucks; but for liquid phase, only trucking is possible for longer distances (beyond
1 kilometre [km] in length). Although for shorter distances (less than 1 km in length), pipeline is
feasible for the liquid phase.

The pipeline option could be selected if the production and storage systems are within the lengths of
the GO rail corridors to keep the capital costs at a reasonable level. Although the return on
investment would take longer than for trucks, but other advantages, including the higher reliability
and lower operational risk, strengthen the choice for the pipeline option. Additional information on
pipelines is available elsewhere82.
However, the reality of Hydrail implementation would occur in phases over a few years, so the first few
trains could go into service even before the full implementation of the Hydrail infrastructure if the rail
vehicles could be refuelled by trucks every day.
The truck option has another advantage in that it may not require the refuelling and dispensing
systems if the logistics of refuelling each train is planned accordingly. The trucks could be coordinated
to refill a small number of tanks near the dispensing point at higher pressure using a compressor for
the gaseous phase. If the trucks carry liquid hydrogen, they can be transferred to the train directly
without buffer refill storage, provided the train is storing hydrogen onboard as liquid. But in real train

operational experience, this arrangement would not work due to increased chances for accidents
(due to many numbers of moving pieces within the refuelling and maintenance facility) and impacts to
the reliability of daily operation.
This scenario of trucks refuelling the trains directly or through a small number of buffer tanks is not
currently considered in this study, as there are unknowns that do not yield sufficient and confident
information to assess the impact. There are two key unknowns: (1) the location of the refuelling
system, and (2) the number of trains that can be refuelled in parallel at these refuelling locations.

4.1.6

Hydrogen Refuelling Subsystem

The hydrogen refuelling subsystem is required to provide enough hydrogen for a full day of GO train
service, so the storage tanks are sized such that they can store up to 24 hours of gas – the volume of
gas required for 1 full day’s service for the RER Scenario 5 train service pattern. These tanks would be

hydrogen for a full day’s service.
The refuelling system consists of the following equipment, as shown on Figure 4-7:

The temperature control is necessary during transfer of gaseous hydrogen onto refuelling tanks, as
hydrogen could cool down or warm up, depending on the pressures, during transfer from the
distribution system.

The design parameters for the refuelling system are similar to those for the storage system provided
in Table 4-4. The main difference within the refuelling system is for the gaseous phase, which is stored
at a higher-pressure range from 70 to 100 MPa. For the current Hydrail System, refuelling tanks are
designed to store the compressed gas at a pressure of 85 MPa, based on similar experience on
automotive refuelling system design83. This would provide enough pressure to fill the tanks onboard
the rail vehicles, which are designed to be at 70 MPa. The liquid storage is done in the same fashion
as it is done in the storage system.

The refrigeration plant is necessary during the transfer of gaseous hydrogen onto the onboard tanks,
as hydrogen warms up during its expansion from the higher pressure at the refuelling tanks into the
lower pressure of the onboard tanks.
For liquid hydrogen transfer between the refuelling tanks to the tank onboard the vehicle, the transfer
lines have to be maintained with good insulation such that the boil-off is minimized.

To achieve 15-minute fill times for each train, the gas flow rate currently existing for the hydrogen
vehicle application (at 432 kg/h or 7.2 kilograms per minute [kg/min]84) needs to be at least 4 to
5 times faster. This requires additional engineering design to split the flow into parallel manifolds. This
is helped by the design of the gas phase storage tanks onboard the vehicle where there are several
tanks. Simultaneous fill of multiple tanks using the parallel manifolds would enable faster fill rates
required to meet the 15-minute timeframe.

planned for the RER Scenario 5: (1) high-power locomotive (with 3 to 6 MW of peak power), and
(2) EMUs (with about 2 MW of peak power per EMU). Both of these vehicle platforms would be fitted
with the following hydrogen-related equipment, shown on Figure 4-9, based on available space:

The vehicle itself would have the power control system, traction motors, regenerative braking, and
head-end power (for HVAC, lights, braking power, and other accessories, including the air
compressors or vacuum system for the brakes).
There are two possible hydrogen storage options based on the physical phase: (1) gaseous hydrogen
at a pressure of about 70 MPa (700 bar) with operational pressure ranging from -20 to 30°C, and
(2) liquid hydrogen at atmospheric pressure and maintained at -253°C. The liquid hydrogen is twice
as dense as the gaseous hydrogen at that pressure.
FIGURE 4-9 HYDROGEN VEHICLE SYSTEM

4.1.8.1 Hydrogen Rail Vehicle: Platform
The powered vehicle (locomotive or powered EMU) design is at the core of the Hydrail System’s
design, providing the total energy required with hydrogen as the primary energy source. There are
three fundamental criteria that were used to design the Hydrail vehicle framework for this study:
1. Power Requirement: This dictates how much traction power is required for each powered vehicle
(delivered through several motors and axles as part of the vehicle platform). There are two
components of traction power:
a) Peak power: Determined by the acceleration required from each of the trains leaving a station
in the GO corridors. The acceleration requirement is not found in the IBC (Initial Business Case)
documentation as a specific number, usually defined as a speed to be achieved in a shortduration (km/h per second or m/s2). So, the basis for the peak power chosen for Hydrail is to
match the rated power of an equivalent electric locomotive or EMU considered for the IBC
model. Figure 4-10 shows the peak power requirement per locomotive based on the intended
acceleration. This shows that the faster acceleration requires significant peak power as well as
being proportional to the train weight.
b) Average or coasting power: Determined by the time allotted between each station as per the
train service plan for RER Scenario 5. There are additional parameters that impact the time and
the average power such as the number of signals; stops made along each journey; and
number of stations. So, an average of coasting power for all corridors was estimated by
CPG-PGM-RPT-245

analysing power profiles from simulation data for at least five GO corridors. This analysis
helped determine the average power requirement per corridor. The average power for this
study as a base-case was estimated at about 60 percent of the peak power.
The peak and average powers determine the total fuel required per train per trip. These power
parameters need to be estimated based on the actual requirement for GO RER Scenario 5, taking into
consideration all the associated changes that would need to be done to accommodate the desired
acceleration. For this study, the total hydrogen required is based on specified peak and average
powers from a known vehicle design available from a rail vehicle manufacturer. Any subsequent study
should pay attention to these two parameters as the starting point.

2. Weight Requirement: The peak power and the coasting or average power would also depend on
the total weight of the locomotive or EMUs. This depends on the train consist configuration with
the number of passenger bi-level coaches to be pulled at peak and off-peak hours. The difference
in peak power required is shown in Figure 4-10 for two train consists:
a) 1+6 consist: 1 locomotive (132 tonnes) with 6 bi-level coaches (294 tonnes) having passengers
in all seats (81 tonnes) for a total of 507 tonnes
b) 1+12 consist: 1 locomotive (132 tonnes) with 12 bi-level coaches (588 tonnes) having
passengers in all seats (162 tonnes) for a total of 882 tonnes
The train weight is directly related to the total energy required to move the train, so dictates the total
amount of fuel required for the train per trip. As an example, the fuel requirement during acceleration
for various train weights is shown in Figure 4-11 For proper comparison, all the fuel requirements

(diesel, hydrogen and electricity) are presented in terms of energy required expressed in kilowatthour (kWh). The respective engine efficiencies listed in Figure 4-11 are the typical fuel conversion
efficiencies for each of the propulsion technologies currently available – diesel (35 percent)86,
hydrogen (50 percent) and electricity (90 percent)87.
Given the significance of the train weight, the fuel savings pertaining to the 1+6 consist during offpeak hours (like EMUs) should be considered when estimating the lifetime costs for operation,
maintenance and replacement. In the current study, the fuel requirement is calculated based on peak
and average powers applied to the start-stop pattern for each corridor. But savings based on changes
in weights are not accounted due to the uncertainties involved, including the lack of a finalized vehicle
design.

3. Space Availability: To minimize the cost of redesign involved in a new rail vehicle platform, it was
decided to use the existing design from either electric or diesel vehicle platforms available in the
market. The available space onboard the vehicle platform was broken down into large blocks for
key equipment or human space (passenger seating in EMUs or cabin for engineers in
locomotives). Figure 4-12 shows the breakdown of space availability onboard the two vehicle
types providing the basis for fitting hydrogen equipment on an existing vehicle platform.

4. Regenerative Brake Energy: Regenerative braking helps recover the resident motive energy when
the vehicle is decelerating to respond to a slow/stop signal or to bring the train to a stop at a
station. From practical evaluation of energy flows in European rail operation, the regenerated
energy with respect to the total energy consumed is given in Table 4-10 in row 4 – “Energy
returned to catenary”. Remember that all the data given in this table is for electric locomotives with
overhead catenary system with the recovered energy directly fed into the grid.

The energy returned to grid as given in the table above suggests that there are energy losses incurred
in returning the recovered energy back into the grid, since there is no onboard energy storage
feature in these electric locomotives to use the recovered energy efficiently. The recovery can be
improved if energy storage capabilities are available, either onboard like in hydrogen-powered
locomotives and EMUs or wayside within the railway control. The recovered energy could be stored
and optimized for later use, and up to 30 percent of energy reduction can be realized, depending on

the vehicle speed, storage size and recuperation ratio89, 90. The efficiency of recovery (recuperation
ratio) could be improved if smart onboard power management systems (combination of batteries,
electronics and sophisticated software) are included in the vehicle design91.
The hydrogen equipment onboard was designed by first breaking down the space occupied by each
component from an existing locomotive or EMU design based on external dimensions from
manufacturer data. This was done in a very general manner, as actual dimensions were not available
for EMUs or for the right locomotive platform.
Then the space available for the hydrogen propulsion equipment was estimated by assessing the
primary components, such as fuel cells (includes power electronics and cooling system), batteries, and
storage tanks. The fuel cell and batteries were then sized based on the average and peak power
requirement of the vehicle platform (EMU or locomotive).
The storage tanks are designed to fill all the remaining usable space available on the vehicle.
Allowance is given to unusable space, including the corners, space between equipment,
passageways, external dimension of tanks, and support structures. This design approach helped
determine the actual number of trips that a train could provide, depending on the peak and average
power of the vehicle.
An onboard storage contingency is stipulated based on prior experience with diesel locomotives. Ten
percent of additional hydrogen was included in the vehicle design, so that there is additional fuel
onboard for unusual situations where a train would otherwise take longer to reach a station. This
contingency affects both the Hydrail System design and the vehicle design:


The Hydrail System is only trivially impacted by the requirement to generate this additional
hydrogen for initial fills and rare occasions when a train consumes this contingency hydrogen.



The vehicle design is affected via the additional space and weight required to carry this additional
10 of hydrogen each trip.

An optimum contingency value should be estimated for design of the Hydrail System and hydrogen
vehicle.

4.1.8.2 Hydrogen Rail Vehicle: Hydrogen Onboard Equipment
Based on the peak and average power required per train per corridor, the hydrogen components
onboard were designed to meet the power requirements. For example, batteries by themselves or
combined with ultracapacitors could provide the peak power needed during acceleration towards the
maximum allowable speed, so batteries were sized to provide the peak power required by the rail
vehicle – locomotive or EMU. The batteries were designed to retain about 70 percent of the state of
charge (SOC) to ensure recharging of the remaining 30 percent happens between stops per trip.
Fuel cells could provide power directly to the motors via the power management system, or they
could recharge the batteries on a continuous basis. In the latter, the batteries would then provide

4.1.8.3 Vehicle Fleet Mix Options
The Hydrail vehicle fleet could include the same combination of the powered multiple units or one or
two locomotives pulling the 12 bi-level coaches per RER Scenario 5. For Hydrail, a stronger case can
be made for two locomotives pulling 12 bi-level coaches in a push-pull configuration, as follows:


Splitting the peak power required by a single locomotive into two half-powered locomotives
enables storage of additional hydrogen onboard each of the two locomotives; thereby, increasing
the number of trips that these trains could provide in a day



During off-peak periods, the 2 locomotives with 12 coaches (2+12 consist) could be split with
1 locomotive with 6 coaches (1+6 consist) to provide the service, reducing hydrogen use



If the 1+6 consist is economical compared to the 4- or 8-car EMU, then the entire fleet mix would only
have locomotives, simplifying the O&M aspects of the GO rail network

System. This dictates how much hydrogen is to be generated. The key design parameter that
determines the total hydrogen required (in tonnes per day [tpd]) for the Hydrail System is the energy
(in megajoules or MJ) used by each train for a given trip across each of the GO rail corridors.
The energy required by each train in each of the GO rail corridors was assessed using the RER
Scenario 5 train service pattern. The energy estimates were based on the start-stop pattern by linking
the peak and average powers required by the rail vehicle with the journey time between each stop.
This energy was then converted into the amount of hydrogen required based on the efficiencies of
fuel cells onboard the vehicle and the electrolyzer within the hydrogen production subsystems. When
this estimate was developed for all the trains over a day in each corridor, it helped in determining the
total hydrogen required per corridor and for the entire GO rail network under Scenario 5.
If the start-stop pattern changes per corridor, say, due to the addition of stations or other signalrelated stops, the hydrogen required for each trip in that corridor would increase. The train service
plan is critical to the Hydrail infrastructure and vehicle design.
To show the difference of the effect of the service plan, the study compares the model results for two
timeframes in the RER Scenario 5 deployment: (1) 2024 as the beginning of the Hydrail train service;
and (2) 2044 as the completion of the deployment of the Hydrail train service with all the additional
trains added since 2024. This would therefore require addition of hydrogen infrastructure to support
the addition of trains in a modular fashion as discussed earlier in the production and storage
subsystems design. Table 4-12 shows the impact of the difference in train service plans between the
two timeframes in terms of locomotives required, hydrogen production, and electricity required.

In the IBC, five RER scenarios were listed, of which Scenario 5 represents a partial electrification of the
GO network. However, Scenario 4 within the RER program involves electrification of the entire GO
network, assuming this could be done. This involves complete conversion of all diesel-powered
vehicles in the GO network with the RER train service plan. When the design basis for the Hydrail
System is applied to Scenario 4 using the service plan, the additional requirement for locomotives,
hydrogen and electricity increased to that shown in Table 4-13.

Note that in both tables above, the number of locomotives for Hydrail is twice the number of electric

halved to accommodate hydrogen in two locomotives of identical power. This provides both range
and flexibility, the former ensuring enough hydrogen to provide a full day’s service, and the latter
allowing for efficient fleet operation between peak and off-peak hours of the day.

Hydrail System Operations and Maintenance

The objective of this section is to present performance and economic outcome data from the
simulated operation of the Hydrail System and its options.
The Operational Simulation Model contains a definition of how the Hydrail System would operate as a
functional railway. It then applies this functionality, in combination to the hydrogen technology subsystems, to a model of the Hydrail System.
Both the railway model and the Hydrail System model are sufficiently flexible to accommodate new
data and options but results from the current underpinning assumptions are presented in this section.
The operational design and the subsystem sizing of the Hydrail System (discussed in Section 4.2.2.2)
were developed using a spreadsheet model created specifically for this feasibility study by scientists
from the hydrogen research group at CNL92. It is called the Hydrail Operational Simulation Model. It
was used to generate hydrogen process results and feasibility level cost estimates for this report.
The results from the Hydrail Operational Simulation Model were then fed into Metrolinx’s IBC of the RER
Program. In this section, costs are reported before applying the financial model assumptions and
conditions to distinguish the change in costs per the system design or cost scenarios discussed later, so,
the costs here are different from those used in the Business Case modelling, described in Section 4.4.

of the lifetimes of various fixed and mobile Hydrail infrastructure is presented in Table 4-14.

Fuel Cells and Electrolyzer Maintenance and Lifetime
Extending the lifetime of PEM fuel cells has been a major objective of developers, and steady
progress has been made, as suggested by the upward curves shown on Figure 4-13. This is
representative of the PEM electrolyzers, as well, since they have similar internal components as fuel
cells, so would follow similar lifetime expectancies.

Currently, leading manufacturers of PEM fuel cells have demonstrated 30,000 hours of lifetime. To be
conservative, this study assumes 25,000 hours for the base or 2024-cost case. For this study, “lifetime”
is not to a point of failure, but the point when a gradual loss of conversion efficiency from hydrogen to
electricity has reached a level that justifies taking the cell out of service and refurbishing it. The
manufacturers confirm that lifetime should be calculated in terms of hours of full-power operation.
For GO trains, it would be conservative to assume 18 hours per day of operation and half of that time
equivalent to operation at full power (to discount periods of no acceleration, coasting, braking, and
being stationary). So, 25,000 hours translates in real-time to an interval between refurbishment of:
25000 x 24/18 x 1/0.5/8760 = 9.1 years
The relationship between fuel cell lifetime and operational life is summarized on Figure 4-14.

Refurbishment consists of disassembly, replacement of the cell’s central membrane, and reassembly.
Today, refurbishment is estimated to cost about 60 percent of the original cost, and this figure is used
in this study. This is a conservative assumption, since future refurbishment costs will likely be less than
60 percent of today’s cost because of the continuing decline in original equipment manufacturer
(OEM) costs for fuel cells.
If alkaline electrolyzers are used, maintenance requirements are insignificant, since this type of cell
operates for decades with an occasional need to remove accumulated carbonate sludge and makeup of caustic.
If PEM cells are used, their technology is to PEM fuel cells, so it is reasonable to assume that they will
match fuel cell characteristics and require refurbishment in the same way after 25,000 hours at the
nameplate-power rating. For example, if 2.8 times more cell capacity were installed than needed for
continuous hydrogen, and current density averaged 3.11 A/cm2 rather than a nameplate rating of
2.2 A/cm2, lifetime before refurbishment would be:
25,000 x 2.8 x 2.2/3.11 x 1/8,760 = 5.7 years
The relationship between electrolyzer lifetime and operational life is summarized on Figure 4-15.

Battery Maintenance and Lifetime
The lifetime of lithium ion batteries (LIBs) is beyond the scope of a preliminary assessment because
their lifetimes are impacted by numerous factors that can be mitigated through design. The effects
include the following:


Pushing the battery to its limits at either the very-high or the very-low ends of its capacity shortens
life. Systems are usually designed to avoid these zones or even to work in a comparatively narrow
range, which could be thought of as a way of adding overcapacity.



High temperatures (above 30°C) shorten battery life, especially when the battery is fully charged.
Charging at low temperatures (below 0°C) shortens their life.



High rates of charge tend to shorten life. This is why integrating them with ultracapacitors can be
worthwhile, since the latter can accept very high rates of charge.

Storage Tank Maintenance and Lifetime
The 700-bar composite tanks for on-train storage of hydrogen have been assigned a lifetime of
5,500 pressure cycles in a study by Argonne National Laboratory93. While specifically for automotive
applications, the critical factor is the diameter of storage cylinders, and this will be effectively similar
for Hydrail. However, specifying 5,500 cycles is a very conservative assumption, since Comond et al.94
have shown that a tank can be designed to sustain 15,000 cycles. The lifetime of these tanks is
determined by flexing of the steel liner. At 15,000 cycles and 1 cycle per day, the lifetime is
40-50 years and comparable to the expected life of the Hydrail locomotive.
The same lifetime expectancy applies to the composite tank construction for the very high-pressure
tanks used to store hydrogen at refuelling locations.
Lower-pressure steel tanks for buffer storage to accommodate optimized operation of the
electrolyzers will experience lesser stresses and have even longer lifetimes.
In short, no provision for replacement of hydrogen tanks will be needed.
Compressor Maintenance and Lifetime
Compressors are rugged mechanical devices and should have indefinite lifetimes if properly
maintained. Exactly what maintenance will be required is impossible to define without specifications
of the equipment to be deployed. However, a detailed independent review for the U.S. National
Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) 95 recommends that the cost of ongoing maintenance would be
covered by adding one-third to the initial capital cost.

4.2.1.2 Railway Operations and Maintenance
Maintaining railway system availability is crucial to providing an efficient and competitive rail
operation. Availability can be defined as the probability that a system is operating properly when it is
requested for use, or the probability that a system is not failed or undergoing a repair action when it
needs to be used. Therefore, system reliability, which represents the probability of components, parts,
and systems to perform their required functions for a desired period of time without failure in
specified environments, is closely related to the availability of the same system. Reliability addresses
the probability that a system is not failed, but because availability is also driven by the probability that
a system is not undergoing a repair, it will also be a function of its maintainability.
Operations
The Hydrail system was designed to provide the same level of service (LOS), or same frequency of
service, to the same number of passengers as presently considered in RER Scenario 5. The Hydrail
service patterns considered are an exact match to the Electrification scenario, and the passenger
capacity in each train consist has also been extracted and copied. The result is that from an operations

point of view, the number of trains per day to provide the service, and the distance in train-kilometres
(km) travelled is exactly the same for both scenarios.
The RER model is also increasing the revenue service train-km travelled by 9.3 percent to consider all
nonrevenue train movements (including dispatching, rerouting trains for maintenance activities, and
run-in to layover facilities) that are required for proper operation. A conservative 10 percent allocation
has been considered in the Hydrail Simulation Operational Model, described in Section 4.2.2, to
account for nonrevenue train movements.
Mixed Fleet Operation
RER Scenario 5 is currently considering a fleet mix of bi-level coaches pushed or pulled by either a
diesel or an electric locomotive. For bidirectional operation, the last bi-level coach is a cab car, and to
provide accessibility, an Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) coach is inserted in the consist. Consists
of 6, 8, or 12 coaches are considered to offer the required service patterns. Also considered in RER
Scenario 5 is the introduction of a new fleet of EMU consists of four or eight coaches.
Table 4-15 presents the composition of the fleet required to achieve the higher frequency and higher
performance considered in RER Scenario 5. Note that the Union Pearson (UP) Express is not presented
in this table because there is no modification of its actual service in the Electrification scenario 20-year
horizon between 2025-2045.

The Hydrail fleet mix can also be similar. Four and eight EMUs can find direct replacement with
hydrogen multiple units (HMUs). Nonpowered HMUs will carry 150 passengers each, like a standard
bi-level coach, while the powered HMUs passenger capacity has been reduced to 90 passengers to
allow space for traction powers and HFC components. Since each multiple unit consist is powered at
50 percent, the passenger carrying capacity is the same in the EMU or HMU configuration.
Each electric locomotive is replaced by 2 HFC locomotives; therefore, bi-level cab cars are no longer
required in a 12-coach consist to offer bidirectional functionality. A standard coach could be used
instead, which would offer slightly more seats for each consist. This difference in increased passenger
capacity has not been considered in this analysis.
For the alternative where diesel locomotives are also replaced with HFC locomotives, the same ratio is
used for the replacement. A 6-car consist is pushed and pulled with 1 HFC locomotive, while a 12-car

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

consist is equipped with 2 locomotives. These configurations provide higher acceleration
performance than the existing diesel configuration and also provide a better power to weight ratio.
Service patterns will also need to be adapted in the Lakeshore West corridors where an eight-car
consist is considered. A single HFC locomotive should be designed to efficiently move six coaches.
Therefore, the existing 8-car trains could be replaced by a different combination of either 6 or
12 coaches to offer the same or very similar number of seats.
As presented in Section 4.2.2.4, there is also an alternative where all EMUs have been replaced by
new HFC locomotives pulling standard, nonpowered BL coaches. The proposed replacement was
made on a passenger seats equivalent basis. Adaptation of the service patterns will be required to
complete the evaluation of this alternative, which is outside the scope of the present study.
EMUs could also be eliminated from the Electrification scenario and service offered with an electric
locomotive with three, four, six, or seven standard coaches, depending on the number of seats
required. The downside of this approach is that, since the locomotive was originally designed for
12-coach operation, it will be overpowered for a smaller consist. From that point of view, the HFC
locomotive is better sized for those smaller consist operations.
Although EMUs are more flexible to reconfigure from small to larger consist and offer better
acceleration performance, they also introduce additional complexity from an O&M standpoint. Since
diesel, electric, and EMUs will be operating on the same corridors, this better acceleration will
somehow be lost when creating the service timetable. The passenger waiting for a train at any station
should not have to remember that at a peak period, the train is an electric locomotive, while at other
times of the day, the line could be serviced by a diesel locomotive or an EMU. The passenger is more
interested in having a constant service, coming to his or her station every 15 minutes, for example,
than the specific performance characteristics of a given type of railway car crossing the station. For
that reason, although an EMU may be able to brake and accelerate faster from any station and recover
time lost during the operation, it will be limited by the slowest equipment running on the same
corridor.
Normally, multiple units (MUs) are used to introduce a new service, where the ridership is lower and it
is more cost-effective to have a distributed power approach than an over-powered locomotive pulling
three or four passenger coaches. This explains why a DMU was the selected technology for the
UP Express. With the increase of ridership, more coaches are added to provide the service and,
eventually, it becomes more economical to pull those coaches with centralized power or a
locomotive. The GO service has already been proven, and high ridership levels are a reality, making
the MUs less attractive economically. The existing diesel and electric locomotives considered so far
have been designed with the goal of pulling 12 coaches, somehow explaining why EMUs are also
considered. The proposed approach of designing a Hydrail locomotive for six coaches also makes the
EMUs less attractive. Fewer coaches simplifies the fleet mix and its O&M, and makes better use of the
existing BL coaches.
Dispatching
The dispatching operation, consisting of trains coming out of the layover facilities to gradually feed
the daily service activities, will be exactly the same for each scenario. Independently of the fleet mix
considered, each train will be prepped for service in a similar manner. Preconditioning of the
locomotives and passenger coaches will be performed using wayside power. Predeparture tests
could be slightly different, depending of the motive power being used, but should have no significant
effect on the dispatching timeline.

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

Operating Range
Since the service patterns are the same, the only remaining difference between the number of trains
that need to be dispatched on any given day is the operating range associated with each technology.
Electric locomotives and EMUs do not have any operating range limitations; as long as the power
infrastructure operates normally, trains dispatched at the opening of the network could operate
throughout the day and clock up to 20 hours of revenue service operation.
Diesel locomotive daily hours of operation would be limited by their operating range, which is
proportional to the operating power profile and fuel-carrying capacity. For the present operation,
centered around a wave operating concept (all trains coming to Union station during AM peak period,
and returning wave during PM peak period), the diesel locomotives need to go to layover facilities
after the AM peak period until they are dispatched again in time for the PM peak periods. Based on
the current LOS, there is sufficient time to refuel the trains during that period; therefore, every train is
systematically refuelled every day, even if it only needs 1,500 litres (L) out of an 8,300-L tank. Diesel
locomotives are operating an average of 7-8 hours per day, way below their potential operating
range.
By 2025, the RER program will replace this wave operating concept and will provide a core network
that has a train every 15 minutes, all day, while outer parts of the network would be served every 30 or
60 minutes. The diesel trains operating under this new scenario will have extended operating hours
every day and will not necessarily be fuelled in the middle of the day. Nevertheless, because a full
tank of diesel provides close to 20 hours of normal operation, as long as all locomotives are fuelled
every day, the 2025 and beyond proposed plan can be achieved with the existing diesel locomotive
operating range. New Diesel-AC locomotives that will be purchased in the future should maintain this
range.
The HFC locomotives will likely have a shorter operating range than its diesel counterpart. A
combination of additional fuelling points at terminal stations and additional rolling stock equipment
may be required to erase the effect of this shorter operating range. Although additional rolling stock
may need to be dispatched daily, it does not automatically imply a larger fleet. It could be addressed
with fewer trains set aside for maintenance activities on any given day, which may be adequate given
that the level of maintenance required on HFC-related subsystems is expected to be less than for the
diesel equivalent. This could also me made possible by the potentially increased reliability level of
HFC over diesel engines.
Run-in Operations
Run-in operations, consisting of the gradual removal of a train in service during or at the end of the
day, when the LOS is reduced or the time to end the service, are also essentially the same for each
scenario. This statement is true if the time to recondition the trains at the end of the day is similar for
each motive power technology, there is enough time between removal of service until the next
dispatch cycle to carry all daily maintenance activities, or both.
The major daily maintenance activity that is different between each technology is the fuelling
requirement, which is covered in the following subsection. Although each technology has a different
cycle time for its fuelling activity, because it can be performed in parallel with other more timeconsuming servicing activities that must be done during that period of the day, there should be no
impact on the number of rolling stock required to prepare the trains for the next day.

Degraded Modes of Operation
Up to this point in the analysis, only the normal mode of operation has been considered. This section
provides a high-level comparison between the electrification and HFC scenarios under a degraded
mode of operation.
From a system point of view, some elements are identical between both technologies. For example,
the rail network and the train control and signalling system are the same, and potential failure of those
elements will have the same effect on the rolling stock equipment and overall service delivery.
Besides those elements, the rest of the systems are different.
Although the reliability associated with the infrastructure (power stations, switching stations,
transmission lines, overhead catenary system) essential to the proper operation of electric trains is
high and offers some level of redundancy, it does introduce an additional potential for interruption of
service. Notwithstanding the initial disruption effect to the existing system operation throughout the
construction period (which also requires raising overpasses and station roofs, and possibly
modification to the rail alignment), failure of any electrification infrastructure elements will create
service disruptions on at least part of the electrified network. Some of the failure modes could
introduce performance limitations to electric locomotives and EMUs, or completely stop the service in
the affected section of the rail network.
Another element that needs to be considered is the additional activities required to maintain this
mainline infrastructure. Although some of those activities may be done at night when the system is not
operational, some activities will need to be performed during the day and will impose speed
restrictions on the portion of the network where the maintenance is carried out.
Hydrail also has an infrastructure that needs to be operational and needs to be maintained to
produce, store, and distribute the hydrogen required for the trains to operate. Those elements are
also subject to some malfunctions or maintenance activities that will limit their operation. The main
difference is that the complete system is designed to offer at least 3 days’ of hydrogen storage for the
complete fleet of trains, providing more than enough time to perform the necessary system
investigation and repairs. Also, independently of the infrastructure design, it will always be possible,
although less practical, to proceed with a direct truck to train fuelling scheme, bypassing the
complete hydrogen-producing infrastructure if required.
Therefore, from an infrastructure point of view and considering the potential impact to the train
operation, Hydrail has an overall advantage over electrification. Can this infrastructure benefit also be
extended to the rolling stock equipment?
To answer this question, the first element to consider is the overall reliability comparison between
diesel, electric, and Hydrail locomotives. In recent locomotive design, the main difference within the
locomotive propulsion system is the main electricity source, since all locomotives use this primary
source to power AC propulsion drive systems.
A diesel locomotive will have a diesel engine, cooling system, fuel tank and fuel delivery system,
exhaust system, alternator, and associated controls to produce the primary power source. For an
electric locomotive, the power source is external; but it needs a pantograph, a transformer, and highvoltage switchgear to harness this external power to the drive system. The equipment required in an
electric locomotive is much simpler than its diesel counterpart, is inherently more reliable, and
provides a higher power to weigh ratio, leading to better performance. For a Hydrail locomotive, fuel
cells, cooling system, hydrogen tank and delivery system, batteries, and associated controls make up
the subsystems required to produce the primary source of energy. Although a Hydrail locomotive has

yet to be designed, manufactured, and tested, based on the maturity level of all components required
to make such a locomotive, its reliability is also expected to be better than that of a diesel locomotive
and comparable to electric locomotive reliability. Because it needs to carry its own fuel, similar to a
diesel locomotive, a Hydrail locomotive will also not be as powerful as electric locomotive.
Nevertheless, besides its intrinsic reliability level, from a degraded mode operation point of view, the
Hydrail approach has two major advantages over competing technologies: (1) its redundancy when
operating a 12-coach consist because it has 2 locomotives instead of 1; and (2) its leap home
functionality, made possible from the onboard batteries.
The introduction of EMUs in the fleet mix will decrease the overall reliability of the passenger coaches.
At the same reliability level as the locomotive, because of the multiplication of systems in any given
consist, up to four propulsion systems in an eight-car EMU or HMU, the overall reliability will be lower.
This will be largely compensated by the inherent redundancy of this distributed power approach. For
example, losing one propulsion package in an 8-car EMU still maintains 75 percent of the traction
capability, reducing the normal operational characteristics, but also limiting the impact on overall
system performance.
The Hydrail system will also need to address a potential degraded mode of operation. Considering
that the rolling stock reliability should be similar to the electric option and better than the diesel
option, that it is not directly affected by power generation infrastructure potential failure modes, offers
some level of redundancy and leap home capability, it should offer a more reliable system. Extending
this approach and eventually replacing all diesel locomotives and eliminating the need for EMU,
Hydrail also represents a level of operational simplification that cannot be achieved with the
Electrification scenario.
Emergency and Rescue Operations
Although each system may have a different reliability level, a degraded mode of operation can
eventually require emergency or rescue operations to remove the nonworking rolling stock
equipment from the rail network.
If the electrification infrastructure fails, then rescue can only be achieved using compatible equipment
that is not electric. Depending on the extent of the infrastructure failure, more than one train could
need rescue from a diesel locomotive. The service could also be temporarily replaced by remaining
diesel equipment. The LOS and performance would then be slightly affected.
For the most likely equipment-related failures, compatibility between electric and diesel locomotives
should allow for appropriate emergency and rescue operation on the electrified portion of the
network, which would remain as it is today for the rest of the network. Hot standby trains will need to
be considered at strategic layover facilities in the network to provide proper operation during
recovery mode.
An extra level of complexity will be introduced with the fleet of MUs in the system. Because of the
different physical characteristics between locomotives and MUs, it is less likely that compatibility can
be achieved between those equipment types. Hot standby trains remain the appropriate response,
but this also means the need for two types of train on standby for rescue operations. This will need to
be evaluated considering the reliability of each equipment type.
The same concept should be used for Hydrail. Similar to the degraded mode of operation presented
in the previous section, based on Hydrail’s foreseen reliability level, redundancy, leap mode, and

equipment type rationalization, should reduce the frequency of emergency operations and simplify
the deployment of hot standby trains.
Maintenance
The maintenance of the rolling stock equipment can be associated to four main categories:
1. Daily
2. Progressive
3. Corrective
4. Overhaul
The first category includes all activities required daily to service each train coming back through run-in
operations to be ready for the next dispatching cycle. Cleaning of all passenger coaches, water and
waste management, cab cars and power car servicing (including top-up windshield wiper fluid, sand,
diesel fuel, and diesel fluid additive for Tier IV engines), and running predeparture tests are likely daily
maintenance activities.
Progressive maintenance activities are normally established around a 90-day cycle, when the
equipment needs to go into a maintenance facility to perform systematic inspection, detection, and
correction of emergent failures either before they occur or before they develop into major defects.
Based on equipment manufacturer recommendations, the progressive maintenance plan is generally
designed to preserve and restore equipment reliability by replacing worn components before they
fail. Some activities need to be repeated every 90 days, while others may only need to be done at
180- or 270-day intervals or on a yearly basis; therefore, every 90-day inspection is slightly different
but normally requires that the equipment, locomotives, and passenger coaches be removed from
revenue service for 3 days.
The ideal progressive maintenance program would prevent all equipment failure before it occurs. In
practice, this cannot be achieved; therefore, there is always some unplanned maintenance activities or
corrective maintenance that need to be performed.
The last maintenance category that covers the heavy maintenance activities and overhaul is also a
planned maintenance activity. This time, the equipment is removed from service for an extended
period, where major subsystems maintenance is addressed. Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning
(HVAC); truck; diesel engine reconditioning; and mid-life interior component; replacements are a few
examples of activities performed as part of this category.
With the introduction of any new equipment or technology, the maintenance plan needs to be revised
to include this new equipment. As a result of this review, the cycle time, amount of materials and
human resources, required training, procedures, tools, and maintenance facilities will need to be
adjusted. Hydrail will not be an exception to this reality.
One of the important modifications to the daily maintenance activities is related to the fuelling, which
is covered in the next section. The other daily activities will remain essentially the same and are not
expected to modify the existing timeline. The progressive maintenance will also be modified and
simplified due to ending diesel-related subsystem maintenance. It is too early to determine if this
maintenance category for Hydrail trains could be shorter than the existing downtime for diesel trains.
Since this cycle is also driven by the passenger coach maintenance cycle, it may not be possible to
reduce the progressive maintenance cycle even if Hydrail locomotive maintenance activities take less
time. This will be reviewed more closely as part of the pilot locomotive design.

Based on Hydrail’s expected reliability level, corrective maintenance activities should be positively
affected, especially after the technology has been proven in revenue service. Nevertheless, this
category of maintenance will still be required.
The heavy maintenance or overhaul activities will also be revised and are expected to be simplified.
The selection of the Hydrail system components will dictate the overhaul cycle. Fuel cell
reconditioning and batteries replacement will be covered in this maintenance category. It is expected
that it will take less time to perform those activities than for existing technology, but frequency may be
higher. The fuel cell meantime between overhaul is currently around 20,000 to 25,000 hours of
operation, which is probably around 3 years of operation, relatively short compared to diesel- and
electric-based technology. Batteries replacement will also drive the overhaul timeline. Proper sizing of
batteries during the design stage as a compromise between performance, weight, and state of charge
will influence this replacement activity. The future development of both fuel cells and batteries should
also improve the time between overhaul.
Infrastructure and Organizational Modifications Required
Table 4-16 presents the expected state of layover and maintenance facilities by the end of 2020. All
the sites presented in this table also allows for minor cleaning activities and minor defect repairs,
supported by local material and parts storage, except for Oshawa and Milton that do not have that
storage capacity. Based on an equivalent LOS, this study considers that the number of tracks at
layover and maintenance facilities will be the same between the electrification and Hydrail systems.
The capability at each facility is presently under review to verify it will also be adequate to support the
expand LOS in 2025. The results of this analysis will also need to be considered for Hydrail.
Once Hydrail is introduced, maintenance yard and layover facilities will not need to be modified to
include the overhead catenary system currently provisioned for in the Electrification scenario.
Although the current height of the maintenance facilities is sufficient to incorporate an overhead
catenary system, for safety reasons, the current plan did not include this building modification.
Instead, electric trains and EMUs will be pushed in and out of the maintenance facilities by an external
source, creating additional operation and limiting the throughput of the maintenance line.
Existing interior maintenance tracks are equipped with sensors and extraction fans to remove exhaust
from diesel locomotives. The same approach will be used for Hydrail locomotives. Different sensors
will be required to detect potential hydrogen leaks, which will trigger extraction fans. The size of the
fan should be sufficient but will need to be confirmed.
Wayside power is available is all maintenance facilities and most of the layover locations, per
Table 4-16. The Union Pearson (UP) Express service track and Oshawa station should be modified to
also offer wayside power. This is important to limit the hydrogen consumption during network
operation. For the same reasons, any side tracks at maintenance facilities, where the trains will preheated or preconditioned before revenue service, should be equipped with wayside power.
The maintenance facilities’ existing workforce will need to go through a new training program to work
around Hydrail and especially hydrogen-related components. There is already a specific certification
program that exists for this technology in Ontario, developed for other industries, that could easily be
adapted to the rail industry.
During the transition period, until the Hydrail system is fully deployed, it may beneficial to create a
specific organization within Metrolinx to concentrate their effort on the successful introduction and
maintenance of the specific Hydrail installation and workforce requirement.

Fuelling
Diesel locomotives presently operating on the network are fuelled every day at one of the three
permanent exterior fuelling facilities in Barrie, Mimico, and Lincolnville. In the case of Mimico, all trains
coming through the site are first directed to stop at the fuelling station regardless of the tank fuel
level.
The diesel locomotives operating on the GO network have a fuel tank that can carry up to
2,200 United States gallons (USG), or approximatively 8,330 L of fuel. Based on a witnessed fill rate at
the Mimico fuel station of 375 L/min, it would take less than 23 minutes to fill an empty tank. Assuming
that this operational process is appropriate to apply to the Hydrail System, we consider that a target
fuelling time for a new Hydrail locomotive should be between 20 and 25 minutes.
Detailed assessment of modifications required to the existing maintenance facilities and additional
review of the maintenance plan will be needed to properly evaluate the impact on Hydrail’s O&M
cycle. The revised maintenance approach can also provide opportunities to further optimize the new
hydrogen dispensing system. For example, fuelling stations can be designed to fill from both sides of
the locomotives at the same time, or maintenance activities like sand refilling, water and waste
management, and daily service cleaning could also be done in parallel to either maintain or reduce
the existing maintenance cycle time.
The existing direct truck to locomotive access points available at most stations on the network could
continue to be used for the Hydrail System primarily for emergency situations.

4.2.2

Hydrail System Operation Modelling

This study is a preliminary assessment and is subject to some uncertainties in moving the RER network
from diesel to electric propulsion, either using track electrification or Hydrail. There are several
scenarios for how the RER network will be deployed. This study focusses on RER Scenario 5 and the
assumptions of Metrolinx’s published IBC for electrification. It is decidedly a preliminary assessment
that deals only with major cost items.
One source of uncertainty comes from the make-up of the train consists. With the agreement of
Metrolinx, for locomotive-pulled consists, the Hydrail configuration uses a 2-locomotive, 12-coach
configuration. This was primarily chosen to provide sufficient space for on-board hydrogen storage
for a full-day’s operation without refuelling96. Moreover, this configuration also offers operational
flexibility of deploying half-sized trains for off-peak service97.
RER Scenario 5 also includes self-propelled double-deck EMUs, and the cost comparison for this
situation is less straightforward, since fuel storage and fuel cells would replace electrificationassociated power equipment. Fuel cells are notably compact, but hydrogen fuel storage is bulky. As
for most other gas-fuelled passenger-transport vehicles, single-deck EMUs can use the space above
the carriage roofs for fuel storage, but the limitation of overhead clearance constrains this option with
double-deck EMUs. So, the precise effect of fitting Hydrail into double-deck EMUs has still to be
determined and could reduce passenger-carrying capacity. This introduces some uncertainty into the
cost comparison.

96 A single locomotive design that has sufficient space for the required hydrogen storage remains a possibility, but identifying such a
design is a subject for subsequent study.

With the Hydrail System, the unprecedented scale of fuel-cell power that would be deployed on
individual trains brings some cost uncertainty, even for this modular technology. However, that
uncertainty has to be seen in the context of steadily declining costs for the key equipment
components, a trend expected to continue.
Operating cost estimates are also subject to uncertainty, since they depend on forecasting electricity
prices over the medium and long terms. Unlike track electrification’s electricity costs, which have no
scope for optimization, the Hydrail System can respond to an electricity price structure that is different
from today’s because of its intrinsic ability to switch its demand for electrical energy, to take
advantage of the lowest prices of electricity each day.

4.2.2.1

Electricity Supply and Costs

At the centre of the case for Hydrail and its costs is the supply and price of electricity, either from the
Ontario electricity grid or from electrical generating stations without the market price structure.
Ontario Electrical Grid Current Energy Supply
Ontario’s electricity supply is predominantly carbon dioxide (CO2)-emissions-free (or green energy)98.
Here, green energy refers to various energy and electricity conversion processes that rely on energy
sources in nature that do not contribute to the emission of CO2 from fossilized carbon-based fuels,
such as coal, natural gas, and crude oil. Ontario’s electricity demand fluctuates both daily and
seasonally, as shown on Figure 4-16.

In recent years, the proportion of wind and solar generation in Ontario has been increasing, and the
proportion of time when the Ontario grid has excess electricity has been rising. The proportion of
time when HOEP has negative or zero value over the last 6 years is shown on Figure 4-17. This reflects
a rising surplus of generating capacity from nuclear and renewable sources that cannot readily be
curtailed. The grid is burdened with an unwanted supply of electricity of no value that it still has to pay
the suppliers for.

Electricity Price Estimates for the Hydrail System
The IESO data (Figure 4-18) show that Ontario’s grid
is supplied by generating processes that are
distinctively unusual in two ways:

Variability of demand exists on almost every time
scale from night and day to seasonal.

Adding together these three factors, the Ontario grid experiences very substantial surpluses of green
electricity every day. The cost of this unwanted electricity is recovered by the Global Adjustment (GA).
The cost of electricity for either Hydrail or track electrification is crucially important to the choice
between the two technologies. The entire premise of Hydrail is that hydrogen will be generated by
accessing this unwanted electricity. In storing electricity as hydrogen, it will time-shift energy demand
by tapping into the unwanted surplus. Consequently, it is our understanding that electricity for Hydrail
would not be subject to the GA.
In contrast, the power required for the Overhead Contact System (OCS) does not alleviate the supplydemand imbalance and would, therefore, likely be subject to GA.
After discussion with IESO102, we have costed the operational cost of the Hydrail System based on
IESO’s actual hourly HOEP figures for 2016, plus the additional charges for distribution and
regulation. Our estimates of electricity costs to produce hydrogen are based on selecting times with
the lowest electricity values for hydrogen production. The results of this analysis are shown in
Table 4-17, in the row identified as IESO set.

However, whether 2016 prices will precisely reflect electricity prices from 2024 on Table 4-18, to a
large extent, uncertain because, on the generating supply side, there are planned additions of
capacity and, on the demand side, there is the potential for growth in time-sensitive demand from
vehicles powered either by electric batteries or hydrogen.
A report by Strategic Policy Economics103 argues the case for hydrogen storage in a seasonal
timeframe and concludes that: “The Hydrogen Economy can provide capacity and reliability benefits
to the electricity system … to smooth the seasonal differences …”. The basic premise of this report is
that the imbalances are going to persist. The Hydrail approach takes this principle further by
smoothing the imbalances over days rather than seasonally.
One variable that might bear on the cost of hydrogen for Hydrail would be a future compression or
spread of the variation of hourly electricity costs around the mean. To examine this, the 2024 base
case was re-optimized with the same average electricity cost but with all HOEP values moved either
20 percent closer to the mean or 20 percent away from the mean. The results are also provided in
Table 4-17.
The difference between the 2016 spread in HOEP prices and those projected for 2024 by IESO is
about 25 percent compression, so the range in Table 4-17 is well within the bounds of possibility. The
contrast between the cases with the 20 percent expansion and the 20 percent compression of prices
shows that effects of compression are diminishing, and further compression would be unimportant.

4.2.2.2 Hydrail System Costs and Scenarios
Hydrogen Handling Phases: Gas or Liquid
For both capital and operating costs, the form in which hydrogen is stored—either as liquid hydrogen
(LH2) or CGH2)—has bearing on this uncertainty because liquid hydrogen is 80 percent denser than
gas at 700 atmospheres. The disadvantages of using LH2 are discussed in Section 4.1.4.1, but its use
has been retained as an option for costing. Cost estimates for four hydrogen delivery configurations
for Hydrail have been prepared as follows:


Central production with pipeline delivery as gas throughout the RER network



Central production with delivery by truck as gas



Central production with delivery by truck as LH2



Distributed onsite production as gas

Producing and Costing Hydrogen
Hydrogen requirements are estimated for RER Scenario 5’s planned train service pattern.
The cost of producing hydrogen is based on the hourly costs of HOEP (plus fixed electricity charges),
the cost of electrolysis installations ($655/ kilowatt [kW]104 at a nominal 2.2 A/cm2 of current density),
and the cost of hydrogen storage ($1,397/kg105). A minimum of these cost inputs is found by varying
storage and electrolysis capacity, and a complex set of conditions to determine when hydrogen will
be produced and at what rate (varied by changing the current density, which modulates the cell

the hourly price of electricity and the level of hydrogen in storage.
The study had initially used the IESO pattern of HOEP in 2016 as input, with the actual cost escalated
using IESO’s Large Industrial Price Forecast Module 4 (selected pertinent parts are provided in
Table 4-18). IESO subsequently supplied their projection of HOEP prices through 2035107. In the
absence of information beyond 2035, the figures for 2035 have been assumed to apply to subsequent
years.

The newer IESO set was used for this assessment. The DRC for either 2024 or 2032 were added to
IESO’s projected HOEP. GA costs have been excluded based on the understanding that they will not
be applied to applications of RER’s nature. The DRC cost element in electricity charges ceases
after 2018.
Water requirements to produce hydrogen are for direct conversion plus evaporative losses to
dissipate heat through a cooling tower; details of the cooling tower have not been assessed, but this
is a minor item of equipment.
Hydrogen Use
Hydrogen produced by electrolysis will move to Hydrail-powered trains in the form either of
compressed gas or LH2. For the main deployment of storage, compressed gas would be stored at
200 to 300 bar in conventional, high-pressure steel tanks, and LH2 in double-walled vacuum vessels.
Four options have been costed:
1. As gas with production at a central site remote from the refuelling points and then delivered to the
train refuelling points by a pipeline.
2. Same as 1., but with gas delivered by tube-trailer-carrying trucks.
3. Same as 1., but with liquid hydrogen delivered by truck; in this case, the costs of liquefaction have
been added. A liquefaction plant would run continuously, and the additional electricity is costed at
the average electricity price, including GA.
4. As gas produced by electrolysis close to the train refuelling points. (Because electrolysis is
intrinsically modular, production could be divided between several sites with little impact on cost.)

In either gas or liquid form, storage capacity (as days of RER Hydrail demand) is determined by the
hydrogen production optimization. Storage for an additional 1 day of demand is added to provide
overnight refuelling of the RER fleet. The land areas for these hydrogen-supply options have been
estimated and costed. These costs are preliminary, as the actual location of the generation, storage,
and dispensing facilities are unknown.
Hydrail Operational Scenarios – Description
There are several operational scenarios being considered for Hydrail, taking advantage of flexibilities
that hydrogen technology must offer for the rail application. To simplify discussions, the Hydrail
operational scenarios are grouped in various ways:
1. Infrastructure Configuration Scenario: The Hydrail system as shown on Figure 4-13 comprises
various subsystems that may or may not be required, depending on the nature of hydrogen
required (gaseous vs. liquid) and the option of producing hydrogen locally or remotely.
2. 2024-Cost Case: This is the high-cost scenario where all the Hydrail infrastructure and vehicle
components assume the start of the RER Scenario 5 (2024) costs—though these are projected to
decline as the volume of production of these components grows.
3. Future-Cost Case: This is a low-cost case where the component costs presume projected future
costs reflecting both design advances and increasing volume of production as demand from other
applications of hydrogen technology grow. The other applications are discussed in Section 3.3, all
increasing production of similar components for hydrogen-fuelled cars, buses, transport trucks,
ships, and forklifts. Demand from stationary applications for the electrical grid and for renewable
energy storage, CHP, and back-up power has already been expanding.
4. Low-Power Case: The base-case assumption uses a locomotive peak power of 7,500 horsepower
(hp) (5,593 kW). This requirement is derived from the initial acceleration required for a full train
consist. It may be too large, so a low-power case was included at 6,500 hp (4,847 kW) to show the
sensitivity to this variable.
5. Fleet Mix Scenario: Since Hydrail would use 2 locomotives for every 12 bi-level coaches, this
allows an option of splitting the train consist into two 1+6 (as discussed in Section 4.1.8.3),
resulting in the same economy of operation as EMUs. There are two fleet-mix options: (1)
combination of locomotives and EMUs in the fleet; and (2) only locomotives in the fleet.
6. RER Scenario 4108: RER Scenario 5 deploys Hydrail exclusively on Lakeshore East, and a mix of
Hydrail and diesel on Lakeshore West, Barrie, Stouffville, and Kitchener. Whereas, RER Scenario 4
is a more extensive deployment with Hydrail exclusively on all GO corridors.
Equipment Capital Cost Sensitivities
Costs for various equipment and subsystems within the Hydrail system is estimated based on cost
factors available from hydrogen technical literature and from market relevant data obtained via
stakeholder engagements. These factors for the two cost cases described earlier for key equipment
are provided in Table 4-19.

A main attraction of Hydrail is that it is an assembly of components from a suite of relatively young
technologies whose costs have been falling steadily over time and are expected to continue to fall.
This is particularly true of the PEM technology (for both the electrolysis and fuel cell equipment) where
Ballard109 has supplied the projections for fuel cell costs, as shown on Figure 4-19.

For the 2024-case, this study used 1197 $/kWe, as provided in Table 4-19. While that looks somewhat
high for 2024, the Ballard numbers could themselves not fully reflect the economies of scale in fuelcell production. In 2015, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) estimated110 current costs for
manufacture of PEM fuel cells in very large numbers ranging from:


US$280/kWe for 20,000 units



US$60/kWe for 100,000 units



US$53/kWe for 500,000

While those numbers look highly optimistic, they indicate the likely trend of prices as production of
PEM fuel cells expands to support other transportation applications using hydrogen.

Broadly, the assumptions made in costing the main components of the Hydrail system seem likely to
be conservative.
Hydrail Vehicle Cost Breakdown
There are two types of Hydrail vehicles similar to the rail vehicles in existence: locomotives and EMUs.

The diesel locomotive is used as the reference for the Hydrail locomotive in the table. Based on
discussions with rail vehicle experts, the cost for electric locomotives listed in the IBC at $6 million is
quite low. To address this deficiency and enable a like-for-like comparison to the Hydrail locomotive,
the cost of diesel is reduced by half from $ 7 to 3.5 million, as per Table 4-20.
From the above table, the cost of a Hydrail locomotive is the result of: 3.5-1+3.86 = $6.4 million. Note
here that 3.86 is the cost of the hydrogen equipment onboard the locomotive, as shown on
Figure 4-20.

Model is summarized by the flowchart shown on Figure 4-22.

FIGURE 4-22 HYDRAIL OPERATIONAL SIMULATION MODEL DESIGN

Key Model Setup for Electricity Price Optimization
This section explains how the CNL Hydrail Model operates to minimize the cost of electricity. It gives a
sense of the level of details involved in the techno-economic estimates for the GO Hydrail System.
The objective of the optimization process is to produce hydrogen at the lowest possible cost, taking
into consideration both the price of electricity (the HOEP set by the IESO) and the amortized cost of
capital. Actual HOEP values for 2016 are the basis used for this optimization. Other cost factors, such
as the levies for distribution and administrative costs, can be added to the HOEP: HOEP+. These
HOEP+ values are deployed in an Excel spreadsheet with one row for each hour of the year.

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

At the two extremes:


One could deploy a massive installation of capital equipment to produce a year’s supply of
hydrogen in the single hour of lowest HOEP+ and store it for the entire year’s consumption.



One could produce hydrogen continuously with a minimum of capital equipment and only
enough storage capacity to provide for a concentrated daily period of train refuelling.

The optimized solution lies between those two extremes, deploying enough electrolysis cell and
storage capacity to produce hydrogen intermittently to take advantage of periods with low HOEP+.
Because HOEP follows a highly erratic pattern, there is no smooth function to determine the optimum.
Instead, the optimizing model allows the user to search for an optimum between the two extremes by
varying the sizes of the electrolysis equipment and storage capacity.
The user also has a series of operating variables that are set to determine whether hydrogen should
be produced depending on HOEP+ and the level of hydrogen in storage. A final variable allows
operation of the electrolysis equipment at a higher current density up to a specified maximum; this is
intended to allow the system to leverage its advantage when HOEP+ is notably low, even though
higher current density raises the electricity consumption to produce a unit of hydrogen. The model
tracks the quantity of hydrogen in storage (expressed in hours of average demand) and uses this to
determine the minimum current HOEP+ value that will be accepted for hydrogen production.
For an acceptable solution, the quantity of hydrogen in storage must always meet refuelling demand;
refuelling is assumed to occur uniformly between midnight and 6 a.m. Hydrogen production is
curtailed so that the storage capacity is never exceeded. On the assumption that hydrogen
production will not change electricity prices, the cost of producing hydrogen by electrolysis is
assumed to be indifferent to how much needs to be produced; any desired quantity is obtained by
linear scaling.
Optimization of parameters listed and referenced in this section allows the user to set two physical
variables: (1) the quantities of electrolysis equipment, and (2) the hydrogen storage capacity. The
other parameters determine when the electrolyzers will draw power. Basically, there are three bands
of electricity price: (3) is a basic low price; (4) is a higher price if the storage level (5) is running low;
and (6) is a storage level that is considered so low that production of hydrogen will occur at any
HOEP+. (7) allows the cell current density to be raised to up to three times the nominal density. This
produces hydrogen in proportion to the current density, but the voltage rises with current density
according to a formula supplied by Hydrogenics; power used is current density multiplied by voltage.
An optimization set is indicated and disqualified if, at any point in the year, the hydrogen in storage
drops to zero. Production is curtailed or switched off when storage is full.
The parameters on the System tab of the Hydrail Model are:
1. Available quantity of electrolysis equipment (a multiple of the requirement for 24 hours per day,
7 days per week [24/7] continuous production)
2. Available quantity of hydrogen storage (in hours of average demand)
3. A threshold electricity price below which hydrogen can always be produced ($/kWh), subject to
space in storage being available
4. A higher threshold electricity price below which hydrogen can be produced ($/kWh) if …
5. … hydrogen storage is less than specified percentage of storage capacity
6. An extreme low level of storage (in hours), below which electricity at any price will be accepted

7. A threshold electricity price below which the cell current density can be raised from its standard
level of 2.2 A/cm2 for a PEM electrolyzer to as high as ...
8. … a (higher) current density level with the power consumption adjusted according to PEM
electrolyzer characteristics supplied by Hydrogenics.
Variables 3 to 8 determined the rate at which hydrogen should be produced in any hour-long period
at a rate that reflected available storage space and current HOEP+. The rate ranged from zero (when
the electricity price was high and storage levels acceptable), to a standard rate (when considerations
of electricity price and storage justify production), to an augmented rate with a higher current density
(when the electricity price was acceptably low).
The variables were adjusted manually to search for the best result. Any optimization unable at any
time to meet fuelling demand is alarmed and rejected.
The eight variables are adjusted manually, usually (but not necessarily) to produce the lowest overall
cost of electricity plus capital recovery. As an example, the average daily distribution of the hydrogen
production for Hydrail in the year 2024 would look something like that shown in Figure 4-23.

4.2.2.4 Hydrail Operational Scenarios – Results
Results from the Hydrail Operational Simulation Model were generated for the scenarios discussed
earlier. Here, the costs provided do not include any financial assumptions and conditions, so they are
direct costs (without any discounting for future time periods), mainly based on equipment cost factors
and electricity pricing. These are presented here to highlight the difference between various options
that are available within the Hydrail infrastructure for both fixed and mobile assets.
Infrastructure Configuration Scenario
The Hydrail System configuration involves locating and grouping fixed subsystems that take
advantage of some characteristics of hydrogen and relevant equipment that handles hydrogen.
Table 4-21 shows the results of four configuration scenarios for the 2024-cost case.

The hydrogen and water requirement shown in the table are the same for all scenarios. The water
consumed by the Hydrail system would be equivalent to about 0.04 percent of the daily water
consumption by the City of Toronto. Most of this water would return to Ontario and the Great Lakes
region via rainfall as the trains operate on the GO network every day using the hydrogen produced
from this water.

The results for the four configuration scenarios are distinct, and some aspects are discussed here:
1. Central production with pipeline distribution: There is about 367 km of pipeline, representing the
physical length of the GO corridors within the RER Scenario 5, on the assumption that hydrogen
could be made available anywhere on the entire network. In reality, this number would be
different, as we would determine more details on the location of production as the next step. The
land area for this scenario is larger than others due to the lower pressure of hydrogen that the
pipeline could accommodate; thereby, increasing the number of storage tanks.

Revision B

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

2. Central production with truck distribution for gaseous hydrogen: There are about 83 trucks (each
carrying about 800 kg of hydrogen) required each day to transport the 40 tonnes of hydrogen
produced to the various refuelling locations. While this is cheaper than the pipeline option for gas,
having these many trucks on the road every day increases the risk for supply disruption.
3. Central production with truck distribution for liquid hydrogen: The number of trucks is down to
13 in this scenario, as each liquid hydrogen truck could carry about 4,200 kg of hydrogen. But this
option puts a huge penalty on the Hydrail system energy requirements from 2.2 to 2.7 GWh/d, an
increase of 18 percent of daily electricity consumption. The storage tanks are also specialized,
which increases the cost of storage by 74 percent. However, this option requires the lowest land
area due to the higher density of storage.
4. Onsite production: This has the lowest cost of the four scenarios, as the cost for distribution is
discounted. If the land area required (16,166 m2) is available at or near the site of the refuelling or
dispensing facilities, then this could be the preferred option for Hydrail infrastructure.
Cost and Timeframe Scenarios: 2024 and Future Cost Cases
As discussed earlier in Section 4.2.2.2, the capital cost of hydrogen equipment used in various Hydrail
subsystems is changing with time due to the evolution in the technology and the volume of
production of this equipment. Using the two cost cases in the Hydrail model, the reduced costs for the
future-cost case are provided in Table 4-22 for the onsite production scenario. Note that the
deployment of the vehicles in the fleet would continue until 2044 (based on train service pattern), so a
comparison is provided for the two cost cases to that timeframe, as well.

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

Between the 2024-cost and future-cost cases (columns 3 and 5 in Table 4-22), the production
subsystem cost is reduced by 20 percent; production storage by 23 percent; refuelling storage by
16 percent; and dispensing equipment by 20 percent. There is approximately a 16 percent reduction
in costs for the powered vehicle fleet – Hydrail locomotives and drive EMUs (not shown in the table).
These reductions would only be realized for equipment purchased after the initial Hydrail infrastructure,
which is set at the 2024 costs. The reduction would affect the additional infrastructure required to
support the progressive increase in vehicle fleet by 2044 and any replacements made during this time
and beyond. The fleet addition reflected for the 2044 case, with 18 additional locomotives, is presented
in the IBC report112. It is also important to remember that the number of HFC locomotives is twice the
number of electric locomotives in the IBC report.
However, the additional requirement for hydrogen of about 8 tpd for 2044 is reflective of the train
service pattern for each corridor, which could be indicative of a higher number of trains being added to
the corridors. Based on the service pattern used in the Hydrail Operational Simulation Model, the
addition of trains extends beyond 2030, up to 2044 in some corridors.
In this respect, the Hydrail estimates are higher than the electrification (OCS) ones beyond the 2030
timeframe, which requires careful consideration when a comparison of lifetime costs is made.
Peak Power Scenario
The hydrogen requirement and every other aspect of the Hydrail system was deduced based on the
peak and average power requirements for the locomotives and EMUs. When the peak power is
adjusted without much sacrifice on the acceleration of the entire train, the change in the system and
cost parameters are highlighted in Table 4-23. A 20 percent reduction in peak power between the
two cases: 7500 and 6000 hp, respectively, shows a significant reduction in costs and energy
requirements, for a 11 percent reduction in the acceleration of the train.

The train consist considered for this scenario is made up of 2 locomotives pulling 12 bi-level coaches
with all seats occupied by passengers, with a total of 882 tonnes of gross weight. The time to
accelerate was set at 60 seconds. If the time savings to passengers is calculated and weighed against
the cost savings to the Hydrail System for a slightly slower commute, then the peak power comparison
should be scrutinized further. Note that the acceleration numbers chosen here are arbitrary just to
show the impact of peak power on the acceleration and the entire system.
Fleet Mix Scenario
The Hydrail fleet mix is included as a scenario and follows the discussions in Section 4.1.8.3, where
having 2 locomotives with 12 bi-level coaches (2+12 consist) was flexible enough to be used as 1+6
consist during off-peak times of rail operations within the GO corridors. Table 4-24 provides a
comparison between the fleet with a mix of locomotives and EMUs versus a fleet with only
locomotives.

Parameters

The biggest change is in the powered vehicles’ cost, with the locomotives-only option providing a
saving of 46 percent when compared to the initial capital cost of the Hydrail system at the 2024
timeframe using the 2024-costs. The significance highlighted here is an indication to scrutinize this
option of having only locomotives for the Hydrail system, provided the locomotives could achieve a
similar time savings as purported to be achieved using EMUs.
RER Scenario 4 Option
RER Scenario 4 assumes that the entire GO network in the current layout would be electrified and in
2024 timeframe and would have a mix of existing diesel-powered vehicles and hydrogen- or electricpowered vehicles in the fleet. The comparison of results between Scenarios 4 and 5 are provided in
Table 4-25. The addition in the hydrogen, energy, water, and operating requirements for Scenario 4
implies the scope of the full GO network electrification. The additional capital required for the fixed
infrastructure is also significant. Due to the modular nature of the technologies involved, Hydrail
would be implemented in stages while taking advantage of lessons learned while implementing
Hydrail subsystems in the GO corridors initially, so these numbers should be used only for the relative
difference between the scenarios compared.

4.2.2.5 Summary of the Hydrail Operational Model Findings
The Hydrail operational model and the maintenance assessment has revealed the following
information:


The model is capable of estimating operational parameters and costs with sufficient rigor that the
improvement in the inputs and assumptions would narrow the error margin.



The costs and cost factors used in this section are for indicative and comparison purposes only.
The actual costs are presented in Section 4.4, along with the BCR.

Electricity Policy and Pricing

Electricity is the flow of electrons from a negatively charged body to a positively charged body113.
Electricity is commonly used in everyday life as a source of energy for a wide range of applications,
including lighting, heating, and powering appliances or other motorized equipment. Power is the rate
(energy amount per time period) at which energy converted (Figure 4-24). The scientific unit of power
is the watt (W), which is equal to one joule (energy amount) per second (time period)114.
FIGURE 4-24 ELECTRIC POWER MEASURES

The amount of electricity that is generated or used over a period of time is typically measured in
kWh115. A watthour is equal to the energy of 1 watt steadily generated or supplied over 1 hour
(Figure 4-25).
FIGURE 4-25 WATT-HOUR MEASURES

Ontario has seen a net increase in electricity production from 2005 to 2015, with production growing
from 156TWh to 160TWh. The growth in production has however, not been met by increased
demand. Changing economic conditions and conservation programs have resulted in non-weathercorrected grid demand116 within the province declining by approximately 10 percent from 151TWh in
2006 to 137TWh in 2015. Accordingly, Ontario currently generates significant surplus electricity,
estimated at 9 percent of Ontario’s net demand in 2016, a major change from the deficits that existed
in the early 2000s.

As the province seeks to improve efficiencies, plans through to 2035 focussed on improvement in the
alignment between demand and supply of electricity, and continuing conservation initiatives and
demand response programs. The following sections will describe the governance and policy
framework that guide strategic planning for Ontario’s electricity needs; Ontario’s electricity system
and generation capacity; and electricity demand forecasts as well as plans to balance the electricity
system, while limiting investment in additional infrastructure.

4.3.1

Governance, Regulatory, and Management Framework

4.3.1.1 The Ministry of Energy117
The Ministry of Energy (the Ministry) facilitates the development of Ontario’s electricity generation,
transmission and other energy related facilities. One of the Ministry’s top priorities is ensuring that
Ontario’s energy needs are met in a sustainable manner.
The mandate letter from the Premier to the Ontario Minister of Energy (the Minister), dated
23 September 2016, outlines the Minister’s priorities, including:


Taking further action to mitigate the impact of electricity prices on consumers and businesses,
partly through expanding eligibility for the Industrial Conservation Initiative (ICI).



Promoting energy conservation and the adoption of renewable energy.



Supporting the growth of the low-carbon economy and reductions in GHG emissions.



Driving efficiencies and maximizing return on investment from the electricity sector.

If successful, these actions will drive efficiencies, lead to an increasing reliance on renewable energy
and encourage greater levels of energy conservation, thereby reducing electricity demand in lieu of
increasing supply.

4.3.1.2 The Ontario Energy Board118
The Ontario Energy Board (OEB) is Ontario’s independent energy regulator, whose goal is to ensure
the energy system remains sustainable and reliable, and that the energy rights of Ontarians are
protected. The OEB’s mandate and authority come from the Ontario Energy Board Act, 1998; the
Electricity Act, 1998; and other provincial statutes, including the Energy Consumer Protection Act,
2010.
The OEB:


Sets rules for energy companies operating in Ontario



Establishes energy rates



Licenses energy companies



Monitors the wholesale electricity market and energy companies



Develops new energy policies in partnership with the Ministry



Advises the Government of Ontario on energy policy

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

The OEB assisted the government in the development of the regulatory framework for Ontario’s cap
and trade program, and is also in the process of implementing a five-point plan to redesign electricity
prices (OEB, 2012-2017a).

4.3.1.3 The National Energy Board119
The National Energy Board (NEB) is a federal body that, amongst other things, regulates the construction
and operation of international and designated interprovincial power lines, as well as the import of
electricity. The NEB also authorizes and regulates energy trade through long-term licences, permits, and
short-term orders. The amount of electricity exported cannot exceed limits approved by the NEB.
In performing its duties, the NEB considers the impact of exports on adjacent provinces and fair market
access for Canadians. The NEB reports to Parliament through the Minister of Natural Resources.

4.3.1.4 The Independent Electricity System Operator120
The Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) manages Ontario’s electricity system, forecasts
the demand and supply of electricity to plan for the province’s future energy needs, promotes
conservation, and operates the wholesale electricity market.
The IESO was established through the Electricity Act in 1998 as a not-for-profit corporate entity.
Through amendments to the Electricity Act on January 1, 2015, the IESO was merged with the Ontario
Power Authority. Through legislation, the Ministry oversees the IESO, which is governed by a Board of
Directors that is appointed by the Province of Ontario. The IESO operates independently of all other
participants in the electricity market.
The IESO forecasts the Ontario’s current, short-term and long-term energy needs, and assesses the
adequacy and reliability of the integrated power system to ensure Ontarians have sustainable
solutions to meet energy needs now and in the future.

4.3.2

Ontario’s Electricity System

Ontario’s electricity system is made up by a network of generation, distribution and transmission
systems that supply electricity across the province (Figure 4-26). The network is part of a larger North
American system, through which Ontario’s network is connected to neighbouring provinces and states.

FIGURE 4-26 ELECTRICITY INDUSTRY STRUCTURE IN ONTARIO

(Source: Adapted, with permission, from the Hydro One Limited 2016 Annual Report)

The electricity system is described in further detail in the sections that follow.

4.3.2.1 Generation
Electricity is the flow of electrical power or charge produced by converting energy into electrical power.
Energy sources may be renewable or non-renewable. The main sources of renewable energy include
solar, hydro, and wind energy.121 Non-renewable sources include fossil energy sources, such as coal,
oil, and natural gas. Nuclear energy, generated from uranium, is a nonrenewable, nonfossil energy
source.
Historically, Ontario relied heavily on
coal-fired generation. From 2005 to
2015, the province significantly
reduced the level of GHG emissions
from the electricity sector, as installed
coal-fired capacity was wound-down
and replaced with renewable and
natural gas-fired capacity. Ontario’s
electricity is presently generated from
wind, solar, bioenergy, hydro, nuclear
and natural gas-fired resources, with
approximately 90 percent of the
electricity being generated from nonfossil sources.

FIGURE 4-27 ONTARIO’S 2015 ENERGY PRODUCTION

The province’s electricity needs can
vary by as much as 10,000 MW in any
given day. The province’s diverse energy supply mix allows for the management of different resources
to perform different roles to meet its varying electricity needs. Baseload refers to the minimum
amount of electric power delivered or required over a given period of time at a steady rate. A
baseload plant is normally operated to take all or part of the minimum load of a system, and

and are considered baseload generation. Natural gas facilities and hydro generators with reservoirs
for storage allow for variable output, as needed. Peaking generators are relied upon to meet the
peaks on the highest demand days, while intermediate generators work throughout the day, with
output adjusted as demand varies. Wind and solar facilities generate variable output, based on
weather conditions. They are highly flexible in respect of the ability to adjust output, subject to energy
availability, allowing for variable but controlled generation.
A key difference between traditional and variable generators is that traditional generators store their
primary energy source (for example, uranium, water or natural gas) onsite and convert it to energy as
needed. Variable generators on the other hand, can only produce energy when the primary source
(for example, wind or sunlight) is available. As such, the principle challenge with variable energy
sources is that they can regularly drive a mismatch between demand and supply.

Installed capacity refers to the maximum
possible output of electricity generators
installed within the province’s electricity
system. Actual electricity production may vary
based on the availability of energy sources
and direction from the IESO to adjust output
to efficiently meet energy needs.

FIGURE 4-28 ONTARIO’S 2016 INSTALLED CAPACITY

There is currently over 37,000 MW of installed
capacity within Ontario’s transmission system
and an additional 3,600 MW of generation
capacity within local distribution systems.
Nuclear and renewable sources represent
approximately 74 percent of the installed
capacity and natural gas sources account for
the remaining 26 percent. Actual production
levels are discussed in the section that follow.
Energy Sources

Nuclear
Nuclear energy, generated by splitting uranium atoms, is a non-renewable source of energy. Nuclear
generation is, however, considered sustainable, given significant uranium resources relative to the
rate of use, and the low environmental impact of its use. Nuclear power accounts for approximately
58 percent of the province’s electricity production. There are three nuclear plants, Bruce, Darlington
and Pickering, with 18 generating units in operation within the province.

Hydroelectric
Hydroelectric (or hydro) energy is generated by converting the kinetic or potential energy of water
into electrical energy. Hydro generation is an important component of Ontario’s baseload and
peaking energy mix. Hydro currently accounts for roughly 23 percent of the province’s electricity
production, and is therefore the most significant source of renewable energy. Given the ability to
predict the level of hydro generation throughout any given day and across seasons, hydro is a stable
source of renewable energy.

Natural Gas and Oil
Thermal generating plants generate electricity by burning natural gas. They can quickly adjust output
based on changes in demand, thereby easily meeting peak demand needs or providing back up for
more volatile wind or solar generation. Natural gas is a fossil fuel, and generates GHGs as a byproduct of energy production. The volume of emissions is however, significantly lower than coal-fired
resources. Natural gas and oil now account for roughly 10 percent of the province’s electricity
production.

Wind, Solar, and Bioenergy
Wind, solar and bioenergy now accounts for roughly 9 percent of the province’s electricity
production. The contribution levels are largely attributed to wind energy, as significant government
incentives along with improvements in technology have resulted in greater output and lower unit
costs.
Wind energy generating potential is greatest in the winter and at night. Wind energy generators can
quickly adjust output in response to system requirements. Solar generation is important to Ontario’s

energy mix, with high production levels during the summer peaking hours. Bio energy is produced
either by combusting organic fuel (biomass) or by allowing organic matter to decompose, producing
CH4, which is then combusted to produce electricity. In Ontario, there are abundant sources of
organic matter as a by-product of forestry, agricultural and livestock, and food processing operations,
as well as from municipal waste. The key challenge to the establishment of bioenergy plants is
however, the high capital cost.

4.3.2.2 Transmission
Electricity is produced from generation plants and transmitted across Ontario’s transmission system at
high voltage before being stepped down to lower voltage for delivery to end-users. The province’s
high voltage transmission system consists of a network of transmission lines that are equal to or
greater than 50 kilovolts (kV).
The stability of Ontario’s electricity system depends on supply constantly meeting demand. The IESO
directs the flow of electricity across the grid, balancing demand and supply to ensure stability. Over
the past decade, the Province has focussed on maximizing the use of the existing transmission system.
Accordingly, significant renewable energy resources have been added without any major expansion
of the transmission network. The network is, however, nearing capacity, and now has limited ability to
accommodate additional generation.
Further constraints are presented when resource potential is not located within proximity to the grid,
as is the case for many of the Province’s untapped renewable energy sources. Significant new
transmission additions typically require a lead time of 7 to 9 years; therefore, the management of the
transmission system requires careful planning.
Capacity constraints lead to congestion in some areas. System congestion refers to instances during
the operation of the power system when there is not enough transmission capacity available to
accommodate scheduled generation. Over the long-term, transmission facilities are efficiently used
where there is a manageable level of congestion. In Ontario, as the use of existing assets is being
maximized, many parts of the system are frequently congested.
Current Grid Capacity
Ontario’s power transmission system is broken down into 10 zones, as reflected in Figure 4-29.

Supply and demand characteristics vary across each zone. As Table 4-26 demonstrates, in three
zones, Essa, Toronto and Ottawa, total resources tend to be lower than peak demand. In contrast,
supply in the Bruce and Niagara zones significantly exceed peak demand, largely due to the presence
of the Bruce nuclear generating plant and the Niagara Falls hydro facilities, respectively. In the
remaining zones, total resources either exceed or are balanced with peak demand.

The East and Southwest zones are not generally congested. The transmission systems in these zones
operate well below capacity, allowing for the transfer of power to the Toronto and Ottawa zones in
addition to supplying local demand.
The Toronto, Ottawa, and Essa zones are load congested. These zones rely on transfers from other
zones to meet zonal peak demand, and the transmission network within the zones operates at or near
capacity during peak load periods.
The Bruce, Niagara, and Northwest zones are generation congested. Installed generation capacity in
the zones is equal to or greater than the combination of demand within the zones and the ability to
transfer electricity out of the zone. This results in the zonal transmission systems operating at or near
capacity whenever zonal generation peaks.
The Northeast and West zones have some transfer capability available. In the Northeast zone,
congestion is more likely than in the West given that it is tied to lower-cost baseload and peaking
hydro generators. In the west zone, capability is limited when natural gas-fired generators are online.

4.3.2.3 Distribution
While some large industrial consumers are directly connected to the transmission grid and purchase
electricity from the Ontario electricity market, most industrial customers and smaller consumers,
including residential consumers, are served by local distribution companies (LDCs). LDCs own and
operate infrastructure to convert high-voltage electricity to a lower voltage, and deliver electricity to
end-users.
There are currently 78124 licensed electricity distributors operating in Ontario. In addition to
delivering electricity to end-users, LDCs perform billing functions reflecting distribution charges and
other charges, as described in Section 4.3.1.4.

4.3.2.4 Electricity Exports
Ontario is part of North America’s large,
interconnected electricity system, allowing for
added ability to manage generation surpluses
and shortfalls. Ontario currently has
interconnections with Quebec and Manitoba in
Canada, and Minnesota, Michigan, and New
York in the United States (U.S.); and can import
and export electricity on a continual basis to
balance the province’s electricity system.

FIGURE 4-30 ONTARIO NET EXPORTS, 2007-2016125

Ontario’s interconnection with neighbouring
jurisdictions allows for the efficient import and
export of electricity based on the province’s
supply and demand levels, as well as that of its
neighbours. This allows for operational and
planning flexibility, and enhances the reliability and cost-effectiveness of the electricity system.
Ontario is a net exporter of electricity, given surplus generation in the province. Net exports have
trended up from 2007 through to 2015, from 5.1TWh to 16.8TWh, but declined to 13.9TWh in 2016, a
trend that is expected to continue based on forecasts for the demand and supply of electricity as
outlined in the ensuing sections.
Electricity exports are priced on the wholesale market, at the HOEP. As discussed in Section 4.3.1.4,
the cost of generating and transmitting electricity is reflected in other charges paid by Ontario
consumers. Therefore, while generating some revenue, exports do not allow for recovery of the full
cost of supplying the electricity exported.

4.3.3

Electricity Forecasts

With the combination of economic and population growth, and improved energy efficiency across
homes and business, all taken within the context of climate change and environmental considerations,
demand and supply profiles have changed over time. This has given rise to the need for a long-term
planning approach to meeting the Province’s energy needs.
The LTEP is produced by the Ministry and is the tool by which the province plans for long-term energy
needs and sets out long term energy policies. The planning process that LTEP follows balances costeffectiveness, reliability, clean energy, community engagement, and places emphasis on conservation
and demand management before building new generation.
Ontario’s first LTEP was released in 2010 and was updated in 2013 and again in 2017. The 2017 LTEP,
released in Fall 2017, covers the 2017-2035 planning horizon.

4.3.3.1 Ontario’s Long-term Energy Plan
The Province’s plans, as outlined in the 2013 LTEP, include:


Encouraging conservation, which will drive planning, approval and procurement processes;



Retracting on previous plans to construct two new nuclear reactors, while moving forward with
plans to decommission the Pickering Generating Station;



Increasing the installed capacity of renewable energy;



Using natural gas-fired generation to allow for flexible response to changes in demand and
supply;



Considering opportunities for clean energy imports from other jurisdictions; and



Exploring opportunities for the use of energy storage technologies.

The 2017 LTEP builds on the plans as previously outlined, with key initiatives including:


Ensuring affordable energy, with projections for the cost of electricity for large industrial
customers to, on average, increase in line with inflation over the forecast period.



Spreading the cost of existing electricity infrastructure over a longer period by refinancing a
portion of the Global Adjustment.



Supporting expanded access to natural gas.



Ensuring a flexible energy system, with a Market Renewal initiative being launched.



Maximizing use of Ontario’s existing electricity infrastructure to limit future increases in the cost of
electricity.



Removing barriers to the deployment of cost-effective energy storage.



Continued commitment to energy conservation.

Based on the LTEP, the expectation is that, by 2025, there will be a significant reduction in surplus
baseload generation (SBG), with demand response strategies addressing peak demand needs.

4.3.3.2 Ontario Planning Outlook
The Ontario Planning Outlook (OPO) was prepared by the IESO in response to the Minister’s request
for a technical report on the adequacy and reliability of Ontario’s electricity resources to support
development of the 2017 LTEP. The report reflects the IESO’s planning outlook for 2016 through to
2035 (IESO, 2017).
The OPO provides an overview of Ontario’s current electricity system, including:


A demand outlook



Potential for resources to meet that demand



Risks associated with various resources



Costs of the electricity system



An emissions outlook for the electricity system

While Ontario currently generates excess electricity, an excess is never planned. Based on the
projection included in the OPO, the expectation is that, by 2025, there will be a significant reduction
in surplus baseload generation (SBG), as discussed further in Section 4.3.3.6, with demand response
strategies addressing peak demand needs.

4.3.3.3 Electricity Demand Forecast
The OPO considers a range of electricity demand levels in Ontario in 2035, from 133 TWh to
197 TWh, under four scenarios:


Outlook A explores lower electricity demand



Outlook B explores a level of demand that roughly matches current demand levels



Outlooks C and D explore higher demand driven by policy choices stemming from Ontario’s
Climate Change Action Plan, including assumptions around the adoption of electric vehicles and
planned electrified transit projects

The scenarios include varying assumptions regarding the level of conservation, more stringent
building codes, and higher equipment standards.
Through the LTEP, the Province is planning for a flat demand scenario as reflected in Outlook B, while
allowing for flexibility to adjust to changes in demand. Additionally, conservation and demand
response programs are expected to have a significant impact on reducing total and peak demand.
Demand Expectations
Under a flat demand outlook
(Outlook B), total electricity demand is
expected to marginally increase, at a
compounded annual growth rate of
0.16 percent, from 143.4 TWh in 2016
to 147.8 TWh in 2035 (Figure 4-31).
The stable demand outlook largely
assumes that population and economic
growth that would otherwise increase
demand are counterbalanced by
conservation measures.

FIGURE 4-31 ONTARIO NET ENERGY DEMAND ACROSS
DEMAND OUTLOOKS126

The outlook assumes an uptick in
electricity requirements for electric vehicles and planned electrified transit projects, including RER and
light rail projects as approved at the date of the report. Taken together, these initiatives are projected
to account for a total of 4 TWh in 2035, of which approximately 0.55 TWh is attributed to transit
projects. Peak demand is expected to be relatively unchanged from 2016 to 2025, ranging from 23.9
to 24.1 MW, and then increasing to 24.8 MW by 2035. Transportation is expected to account for
2 percent of peak demand in 2035 (IESO, 2016).
Under a higher demand outlook (Outlook D), in 2035 the total electricity demanded is projected to be
197 TWh. This assumes an increase in residential and commercial electricity demand due to increased
electrical space and water heating, accounting for a total increase in electricity demand of 30 TWh.
Outlook D also assumes a shift to electricity based energy generation in the industrial sector, an
increased number of electric vehicles (2.4 million by 2035), and electrification of transit, accounting
for approximately 9 TWh and 0.65 TWh, respectively. Peak demand is expected to grow to 35.4 MW
by 2035 (IESO, 2016).

The difference between summer and winter
peak varies across demand outlooks and across
the forecast period. There is currently a
difference of approximately 1,800 MW between
summer and winter peak demand (Figure 4-32).
Over the forecast period, under a stable
demand outlook, the variance is expected to
increase to 2,369 MW in 2036. Under higher
demand outlooks, Ontario is expected to
become a winter peaking province; if this
occurs, the variance between summer and
winter peak demand is significantly reduced by
2025, and winter peak demand is projected to
exceed summer peak demand by as much as
6,900 MW in Outlook D128.

FIGURE 4-32 NET SUMMER PEAK MINUS NET
WINTER PEAK127

Conservation and Demand Response Programs
A significant percentage of the forecasted growth in electricity demand is expected to be offset by
conservation programs and improved codes and standards. The LTEP includes a long-term
conservation target of 30 TWh in 2032.
Demand response programs provide a variety of incentives to encourage end-users to reduce
electricity use during peak hours. Demand response initiatives led to a reduction in peak demand of
approximately 1.8 gigawatt (GW) in 2015 and are expected to reduce peak demand by 10 percent, or
approximately 2.5 GW by 2025.

4.3.3.4 Electricity Supply Forecast
Supply assumptions are based on existing
resources that have been procured but are not
yet in service, and resources that have neither
been procured nor acquired as of the date of
the OPO, but have been directed to meet
provincial policy objectives.

FIGURE 4-33 INSTALLED CAPACITY AND CAPACITY
CONTRIBUTIONS129

Assuming that all current resources continue
until contract expiration and all nuclear
refurbishments, as well as committed and
directed resources, come into service as
scheduled, total installed capacity is expected
to slowly increase from 39.6 GW in 2016 to
42.6 GW in 2035, 7 percent growth over the
Source: (IESO, 2016)
period. While the installed capacity increases,
there will be an increasing reliance on renewable energy sources, which are, in the case of solar and
wind, more variable. Accordingly, while installed capacity generally increases, except for a decline in
the late 2020s, the capacity contribution of resources is generally unchanged over the forecast period.

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

Expectations for each source of electricity, based on current resources as well as committed and
directed resources, are described in the following paragraphs.

Nuclear
While previous forecasts indicated the need for additional nuclear generating capacity, based on the
current outlook, and given revised demand forecasts, additional capacity is not necessary.
Accordingly, the Province is not planning to move ahead with plans to build additional nuclear plants
and will proceed with plans to decommission the Pickering plant, which currently has six units in
operation and an installed capacity of 3,100 MW. Two units will be retired at the end of 2022 and four
units at the end of 2024.
Nuclear energy is expected to account for 48 percent of Ontario’s electricity production in 2035
The Province retains the option to build additional nuclear capacity if future needs dictate. It is the
Ministry’s intention to maintain the licence granted by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission for
the construction of new nuclear units.

Hydro
Ontario has significant additional hydro potential; however, most of the potential exists in relatively
remote northern communities, and would, therefore, be developed at a relatively high cost. Hydro
power is expected to account for 27 percent of total electricity production in 2035.

Natural Gas
The natural gas fleet allows for flexibility to respond to variability in renewable energy sources. This
relatively low-carbon source is, therefore, an important part of Ontario’s supply mix. Natural gas
production is expected to account for 9 percent of total electricity production in 2035.

Wind, Solar and Bioenergy
Wind, solar and bioenergy are expected to make more significant contributions to Ontario’s energy
mix in 2025 and beyond. Collectively, these non-water renewables are expected to account for
16 percent of electricity production in 2035, largely due to the expansion of wind electricity
production.

4.3.3.5 Forecasted Demand Relative to Supply
The IESO’s assessment is that there are sufficient resources to meet flat demand levels (Outlooks B),
with relatively low surplus generation during peak demand periods. The higher demand scenarios
would, however, present challenges of scale and integration, requiring the deployment of multiple
low-carbon options and significant investments in transmission and distribution systems. The OPO,
however, underscores the need for more conservation, rather than investment in additional
generating capacity, to meet the higher demand under those scenarios. The Province will be able to
adapt to a lower demand scenario by choosing not to renew existing contracts for generation upon
expiration, if the energy is not needed.
The capacity contribution (that is, maximum output) of installed capacity relative to peak demand
(including a planning reserve) under Outlook B is outlined below (Figure 4-34).

The forecast suggests that under a stable demand scenario, Ontario will generate sufficient electricity
to meet peak demand. In a higher demand outlook such as Outlook D, the province is expected to
have sufficient resources to meet demand through to 2022 however additional resources would be
required to meet demand beyond 2022. It is however noted that demand and supply forecasts are
based on a variety of assumptions, including median weather conditions and consumer preferences
such as actual adoption of electric vehicles and use of electricity for home heating, to name a few.
Extreme weather events or significant changes in consumer preferences can therefore have a
significant impact on forecasts.

4.3.3.6 Surplus Baseload Generation
SBG refers to baseload generation in excess of provincial demand plus net exports. SBG is managed
through exports, by diverting water from hydro turbines, by curtailing wind and solar generation, and
by managing units at the Bruce Nuclear Generating Station.
In FYE 2016, as shown on Figure 4-35, SBG
amounted to approximately 9 percent of
Ontario net demand. The OPO indicates that
SBG is expected to decline through to 2035,
largely due to the decommissioning of the
Pickering Nuclear Generating Station and, from
2020-2028, as units at the Darlington and Bruce
Nuclear Generating Stations are being brought
out-of-service for refurbishment in the 2020s.
Periods of SBG will be further impacted by:

4.3.3.7 Forecasted Grid Capacity
Capacity of the transmission network has implications for the location, size, and number of hydrogen
generation facilities proposed to support Hydrail. Consideration would need to be given to
forecasted capacity and congestion levels within each zone of the electricity system, which will have to
be weighed against the cost associated with larger hydrogen generation and storage facilities, ability
of the supplier to exercise flexibility in the timing of hydrogen production, and the cost of hydrogen
transportation.
While congestion in the system is currently manageable, future changes in demand and supply can be
expected to increase congestion challenges as more variable and distributed energy resources come
into service. Additionally, the retirement of the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station may increase
flows from southwestern Ontario, resulting in higher congestion in the Southwest and Toronto zones.
As Figure 4-36 shows, generation capacity in the
Toronto and Bruce zones are expected to
decline by 2020, due to a reduction in nuclear
generation. Assuming flat demand, it can be
expected that load congestion in the Toronto
zone will be magnified, while generation
congestion in the Bruce zone is expected to be
somewhat alleviated, but not eliminated.

FIGURE 4-36 ZONE GENERATION CAPACITY

Generation capacity in the East, West, and
Southwest zones is expected to increase.
However, as noted in Section 4.3.2.2, these
zones are currently uncongested, with some
transfer capability.

Electricity Pricing

Electricity prices in Ontario primarily comprise
the HOEP and the GA. Transmission,
distribution, regulatory, and other charges
combined may also account for roughly
20-30 percent of prices, and vary depending on
location within the transmission grid.

FIGURE 4-37 HOEP VS. GA

The HOEP is the wholesale price of electricity
and is determined in a real-time market,
operated by the IESO. The HOEP changes
hourly, based on demand and supply of
electricity. It is significantly impacted by time of
day, day of week, weather factors, and economic
conditions.
Every day, the IESO forecasts electricity demand for the days and weeks ahead. Generators and
electricity importers submit offers to supply electricity and indicate the prices they are willing to
accept. Large customers and exporters submit bids for electricity purchases at specified prices. The
IESO accepts the lowest cost offers to supply electricity to meet demand. A new market clearing price
is set every 5 minutes. The HOEP is the average of the 12 market clearing prices set in each hour. The
impact of demand and supply forces on the electricity market results in a higher HOEP during peak
demand periods and a lower HOEP during periods of excess supply (SBG).
The GA is paid by all Ontario electricity customers, and reflects the net cost of electricity generation
and the cost of delivering conservation programs. The GA varies monthly, adjusting for the difference
between the HOEP and the cost of regulated and contracted generation.
The main components of the GA are:


GA-OEFC-NUG (M$) – Contracts administered by the Ontario Electricity Financial Corporation with
existing generation facilities



GA-OPG (M$) – Ontario Power Generation nuclear and baseload hydro generating stations



GA-OPA (M$) – Contracts with the IESO (and with the former Ontario Power Authority) for new
gas-fired generation, renewable facilities, energy from waste and biomass, nuclear
refurbishments, as well as conservation programs.

4.3.4.1 Electricity Pricing for Large Businesses
Industrial customers with an average peak demand of over 1 MW and targeted manufacturing and
industrial customers with peak demand of over 500 KW and under 1MW (collectively, Class A
customers) are eligible for participation in the Industrial Conservation Initiative (ICI), which was
introduced in 2010.
Through the ICI the GA attributed to participating customers is calculated based on the customer’s
percentage contribution to the top five peak Ontario demand hours, over a 12-month base period.
The ICI, therefore, allows participating customers to manage their GA costs by reducing demand
during peak periods, and allows the province to defer building new electricity infrastructure to meet
peak demand. It is estimated that in 2016, the ICI helped to reduce peak electricity demand by
approximately 1.3 GW.

The peak demand factor (PDF) is calculated by taking the sum of the customer’s demand during the
top five peak Ontario demand hours in the base period (May 1 to April 30), and dividing it by the total
system consumption during those hours. The calculated ratio is the customer’s peak demand factor.
The customer’s monthly GA cost is calculated by multiplying the PDF by the provincial GA cost in each
of the ensuing 12 months (July 1 to June 30).
A participating customer can manage their GA costs by reducing electricity use during forecasted
peak hours. The IESO provides tools to track current and projected demand, along with a forecast of
system conditions. Peak periods generally coincide with:


Heat waves in the summer or cold snaps in the winter



Weekday afternoons in the summer



Early weekday evenings during the winter

A customer who can significantly reduce electricity usage during peak hours will have relatively
minimal GA costs. It is however noted, as discussed in sections 4.3.3.5 and 4.3.3.6, that a variety of
factors can impact demand patterns and that demand patterns are expected to the change in the
future. An important consideration for Hydrail is that peak demand hours may be more difficult to
predict than they are presently.

4.3.4.2 Policy Initiatives Impact on Electricity Prices in Ontario
Electricity prices are driven by decisions of the past and those decisions impact prices long into the
future. Policy initiatives or pricing regimes may either shift the cost of investments from one user
group to another or defer costs to future generations, based on economic or social factors at play at
the time of consideration. As history has shown in Ontario, electricity policy and investment priorities
change over time and likely will continue to evolve as market conditions and government policy
priorities evolve.
The ICI is a policy initiative of the Government of Ontario that was designed to reduce peak demand
and to support Ontario’s industrial sector. While the ICI has effectively achieved its objective to date,
the policy could be challenged on merit, as it may be argued that the ability to shift consumption of
electricity away from peak hours should not absolve a company of its obligation to share in the costs
that the GA is designed to recover.
Notwithstanding, it is noted that electricity pricing in Ontario is generally expected to move to more of
a market-driven model. Under such a model, consumption during hours of high demand should
ultimately result in higher electricity costs, with the reverse also applying. Accordingly, while the ICI
may be terminated or decline in significance in the future, the principle upon which it is based will
likely still apply.
Other recent policy initiatives of the Province have led to an average 25 percent reduction in
electricity prices for residential and small business customers in 2017 under the Fair Hydro Act, 2017.
Initiatives under the Fair Hydro Act 2017 include refinancing of a portion of the GA to spread the cost
of electricity investments over a longer time period, thereby reflecting the longer lifecycle of existing
facilities, and sharing the costs with future generations.
As outlined in the 2017 LTEP, the government is also considering measures to provide electricity rate
assistance to non-Class A mid-sized customers (Class B customers). One such consideration is a
change to the way the GA is charged to these customers, who currently pay the same GA charges
regardless of time of use. It is not yet known whether these measures will impact the way GA costs are
charged to other customers.

4.3.4.3 Market Renewal
Market Renewal is a set of initiatives intended to redesign Ontario’s electricity market, leading to
reduced supply costs and increased flexibility. These initiatives will:


Improve the way Ontario acquires supply to meet medium- and long-term needs;



Enable the IESO to more cost-effectively schedule and dispatch electricity to meet demand as it
changes from hour-to-hour and minute-to-minute; and



Increase flexibility, enabling the IESO to more efficiently manage unexpected short-term changes
to the system, like those that can be caused by variable generation such as wind and solar.

Market renewal is expected to result in cost savings, given more efficient use of existing assets, which
is consistent with the province’s long-term plans. It will also lead to greater market competition and a
more flexible procurement process that is better aligned with system needs.

4.3.4.4 Pricing Outlook
Under Outlook B, the IESO expects that the average unit cost of operating the electricity system will
gradually increase to $152/MWh by 2025, relative to $144/MWh in 2016. Thereafter, the cost is
expected to generally decline to $131/MWh by 2035. The decline is based on the renewal of existing
generating contracts at lower rates, as existing generators continue to operate at costs below existing
contract rates, and given reduced investment in electricity resources.
Under Outlook D, the cost of electricity in
2025 is expected to range from $155/MWh to
$160/MWh, given the need to invest in
additional resources to meet higher demand,
while keeping emissions low. The average
unit cost is expected to generally decline,
ranging from $137/MWh to $142/MWh by
2035, as existing contracts are renewed at
lower rates and higher volumes reduce the
average cost of operation.

FIGURE 4-38 CLASS A ELECTRICITY PRICE FORECAST

The projection for the price of electricity for a
typical large industrial customer, as presented
in the 2017 LTEP is outlined in Figure 4-38.
The all-in price of electricity, reflecting the HOEP, transmission, regulatory and other costs, and the
GA, is expected to range from $102/MWh in 2025 to $116/MWh in 2035.

4.3.5

Implications for Hydrail

4.3.5.1 Provincial Policy Objectives
Electrification of transportation, both by means of overhead electrification and using HFC technology,
is consistent with policy objectives as set out in the Premier’s mandate letter to the Minister of Energy.
The use of HFC technology presents the added benefit of supporting the growth of the low-carbon
economy and the reduction of GHG emissions, by potentially allowing for a broader replacement of
diesel trains on the GO network with electric trains than would be possible through overhead
electrification. Further to this, Hydrail could allow for load-shifting, by consuming electricity when
there is SBG, versus adding to peak demand as would be the case with overhead electrification.
CPG-PGM-RPT-245

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

Hydrail, therefore, also could support the Province’s goal of driving efficiencies and limiting
expenditure on new electricity infrastructure.

4.3.5.2 Capturing SBG
The assessment shows that, while the level of SBG is expected to decline, electricity production is
expected to exceed Ontario net demand by 1-4 percent from 2024 to 2035. There are however
seasonal variations in the level of SBG and, particularly given the increasing reliance on renewable
energy in the province’s energy supply mix, weather related factors can further impact electricity
generation, and therefore SBG. SBG is often available over short periods of time and to fully capture it
would require an infrastructure build-out that would allow for the production and storage of hydrogen
over short periods of time, which would be idle outside of these periods.
The ability to harness SBG to produce hydrogen is a function of the scale of hydrogen production
(current density) and storage (volume) infrastructure, relative to when the SBG is available. Using
hydrogen production and storage assumptions from the Hydrail simulation model, along with
demand projections as presented in the 2016 OPO, modelling work shows that only approximately
14-35 percent of the annual amount of hydrogen required to support Hydrail can be produced from
electricity supplied during periods of SBG over the 2025-2035 time frame. Furthermore, the same
analysis shows that only 6-23 percent of operating days over the forecast period could be fully
supplied by SBG.
A further consideration is the province’s plans to incorporate energy storage technologies in
managing the electricity system. The use of such technologies will lead to a further reduction in excess
supply, as surpluses would be at least partially captured and stored by the province, thereby reducing
the amount supplied to the market. The use of energy storage technologies would limit the ability of
market participants to capture surplus baseload generation.
Therefore, it is unlikely that the Hydrail System will be able to operate solely on electricity produced
during periods of SBG. Accordingly, while the system would be able to avoid Ontario peak demand
hours, therefore producing during off-peak hours, the system as currently designed, will not be able
to consistently minimize the price of electricity, as it will be limited by the density of the hydrogen
production facilities and the capacity of the hydrogen storage facilities.

4.3.5.3 Electricity Pricing
As noted in the preceding sections, the HOEP is market driven, with lower prices during periods
where the supply of electricity exceeds demand. Further to this, based on the current pricing structure
and government policy initiatives, the ability to consume electricity outside of peak provincial demand
hours can allow for the elimination of GA costs. On this basis, assuming the current pricing and policy
regimes remain in effect, Hydrail presents certain benefits in respect of the unit cost of electricity
relative to overhead electrification. These benefits are derived from the flexibility to schedule
hydrogen production outside of Ontario peak demand hours, thereby minimizing or avoiding GA
charges, and at times of lower HOEP thereby realizing lower electricity costs. This benefit must be
weighed against the increased rate of consumption of electricity (for traction) in the case of Hydrail
relative to overhead electrification, which could somewhat negate the unit cost advantage of Hydrail
when considering the total overall cost of electricity.
A further consideration is the potential shift in provincial demand patterns and the impact this will
have on the peak/off-peak variance in the HOEP. The production of hydrogen will result in an increase
in demand for electricity during periods of hydrogen production, which, given the significant load it
will represent, could cause upward pressure on prices during that period. Additionally, as the

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

province encourages the electrification of transit and demand response programmes, both of which
shift demand away from peak periods, it can be expected that there will be increased demand for
electricity during traditional off-peak periods, which could in-turn increase the HOEP during these
periods. This will likely result in a reduction of the variance in HOEP, and therefore also a reduction in
cost advantage for consumption during traditional off-peak periods. Should this be the case, the unit
cost advantage of Hydrail relative to overhead electrification will be partially eroded.
The government’s ICI program is intended to help flatten out the daily energy consumption profile by
shifting demand to off peak periods. The success of these programs can be viewed as a risk to the
Hydrail business case, especially considering the significant electricity requirements to produce
hydrogen at the required scale for the rail network.

4.3.5.4 Location of Hydrogen Generation Facilities
As noted in Section 4.3.2.2, there are load and generation constraints in some zones across the
Ontario electricity system. At present, decentralized hydrogen production to support Hydrail is being
considered. Relative to centralized production, decentralized production would allow for smaller
loads being drawn across different zones of the grid, from production facilities located along each line
of the GO network. There are pros and cons to decentralized production, depending on the capacity
constraints within the zones being contemplated and the location of potential hydrogen generation
facilities relative to the GO network. Such matters would be resolved through detailed planning and
procurement activities.
The GO network extends across the East, Essa, Toronto and Southwest zones. In the East and
Southwest zones, generation either exceeds or meets peak demand, with generation capacity
expected to increase by 2020. Both zones are generally uncongested, and should therefore allow for
additional loads. The Lakeshore East line extends into the East zone, while the Lakeshore West and
Kitchener lines extends into the Southwest zone.
In the Toronto and Essa zones, resources are less than peak demand, and both zones are load
congested. The situation within the Toronto zone is expected to be magnified by the anticipated
decommissioning of the Pickering nuclear generating plant by 2024.
All GO lines run through the Toronto zone, however there may be locational challenges within the
zone (space, property zoning, environmental, price), which may be compounded by limited public
acceptance, particularly given the urban setting, as discussed in Section 4.8. The Barrie, Stouffville and
Richmond Hill lines all run through the Essa zone.
A decentralized approach to hydrogen production (described in Section 4.1) would involve the
establishment of generation facilities along each line of GO network, crossing each of the four zones
discussed. The significant advantage of decentralized generation is the cost advantage of smaller
facilities along each line of the GO network. Based on the foregoing, there may however, be other
challenges associated with this approach. One significant challenge is the limited capacity within
Toronto, a situation that is expected to persist for the foreseeable future.
A similar challenge would also be faced in the Essa zone. Further to this, consideration should also be
given to the competing demands of electric vehicles, the continued adoption of which the 2017 LTEP
acknowledges could have a significant impact on the province’s distribution network. Should
hydrogen generation facilities be established within these zones, careful planning would be required
to ensure hydrogen generation does not inadvertently stress local grids.
Centralized hydrogen production facilities could be placed within the East zone, along the Lakeshore
East line. In a semi-centralized scenario, hydrogen generation facilities could be located in the East
and Southwest zones, along the Lakeshore East, Lakeshore West and Kitchener Lines.

Electricity Pricing Forecast for Hydrail

Electricity prices for RER under Hydrail have been projected based on forecasted electricity prices in
Ontario and the Hydrail production simulation model. The electricity price assumptions are outlined in
Table 4-27.
TABLE 4-27 ELECTRICITY PRICE ASSUMPTIONS
Price Component
Hourly Ontario
Electricity Price
(HOEP)

Assumptions
The forward looking HOEP was estimated by IESO using the following logic:


Historical HOEP pattern for each year was developed by dividing each hourly HOEP by the
annual average to get the yearly mean-normal pattern.



The most representative historical HOEP pattern was selected for each of the projected years
(2017-2035)



Historical HOEP patterns were scaled to the appropriate annual average marginal cost using
numbers in-line with the 2017 LTEP.

Global Adjustment

The forward-looking GA charges are based on the forecast presented in the 2013 LTEP for a
typical industrial customer. It is noted that, with the introduction of Hydrail, projected GA charges
may be impacted, as discussed in Section 4.3.4. An assessment of the impact of same is,
however, not within the scope of this study, and accordingly no adjustments have been made to
the forecasts presented in the LTEP.

Regulatory and
Transmission charges

The forward looking regulatory and transmission charges are based on the forecast presented in
the 2013 LTEP.

The Hydrail Operational Simulation Model (described in Section 4.4.1) includes an algorithm that uses
the HOEP price and the amount of hydrogen required for the Hydrail System to create a hydrogen
production schedule that minimizes the cost of electricity, subject to the capacity of the hydrogen
production and storage facilities.
Given the optimized production schedule as described above, no electricity would be consumed
during Ontario peak hours and therefore, under the ICI, the system would not be subject to GA. The
ICI is however, a policy initiative and therefore subject to changes as discussed in section 4.3.4.1. On
this basis, two pricing scenarios were developed based on whether the system is subject to GA
charges.
In the low case, the electricity price is estimated based on the assumption that the system operator
pays no GA charge. In the high case, it is assumed that the ICI is discontinued and therefore, the
operator pays full GA charges.
The electricity pricing scenarios for Hydrail are presented in Table 4-28.

4.3.7

Summary of Key Findings

The foregoing assessment of the Ontario electricity system, pricing and policies indicates that in
considering electrification of the GO network with Hydrail, electricity pricing assumptions must
consider:


The possibility of being unable to consistently capture SBG due to an increase in demand for
electricity, combined with relatively stable supply, increased use of energy storage technologies
and reducing the occurrence of SBG. Due to these factors as well as the limitations of the
production and storage facilities, conservative assumptions should be made about capturing SBG
and the electricity prices associated with off-peak energy usage.



A change in electricity pricing policy negatively impacting on electricity pricing. As noted in
Section 4.3.4, the current pricing regime may change such that the ability to avoid GA charges
does not persist in the future. This will have a significant impact on the overall cost of electricity
and will reduce the unit price advantage that would be afforded to Hydrail under the current
regime.



A shift in demand profiles leading to a smaller differential in peak and off-peak pricing peak. The
load presented by Hydrail is significant; therefore, it will impact provincial electricity, given the
shift in the demand profile during off-peak periods. This will reduce the differential between peak
and off-peak hours, thereby reducing the unit price advantage of Hydrail relative to overhead
electrification.



The impact of the added load required by Hydrail on overall electricity prices (given an increase in
demand). In addition to impacting electricity pricing during off-periods, the load introduced by
Hydrail will increase overall demand for electricity, also driving an overall increase in the price of
electricity, given the expectation for supply to remain relatively constant. A further consideration is
the impact on the GA, as an increased load consuming what would otherwise be surplus
electricity, should result in a general reduction in the GA charges applied across all customers.

Further to this, in determining whether to take a centralized or decentralized approach to hydrogen
generation, careful consideration should be given to load constraints within different zones of the
electricity system, and the implication for the ability to operate electrolyzers without any destabilizing
effects on the electricity grid.

Costs and Benefits

One of the primary goals of the feasibility study is to analyze the anticipated financial impact of Hydrail
on the RER program. To perform this analysis in a way that will allow for a comparison of Hydrail and
the currently contemplated electrification scenarios, models that are in use by Metrolinx were used as
the starting point for the analysis presented in this section.
The financial impact was analyzed by following six steps:
1. The GO RER network was modelled by CNL (the “Hydrail Operational Simulation Model”) to
determine the requirements of a Hydrail System (quantity of hydrogen needed, infrastructure
requirements, fuelling).
2. The IBC model from 2014 was analyzed to gain an understanding of how the BCR was developed
and to identify the key items that would change under a Hydrail scenario.
3. Relevant cost inputs from the Hydrail simulation model were used to update the IBC model. An
interface sheet was developed to capture capital, capital replacement, operating, and
maintenance costs for Hydrail.
4. Low- and high-cost scenarios were developed for key input variables (for example, cost of
electricity, capital costs of Hydrail components and life cycle of assets). These assumptions were
used to develop a range of costs for the Hydrail System.
5. A sensitivity analysis was then performed to determine which cost inputs have the most significant
impact on total cost. Those costs were then further scrutinized.
6. Based on the results of the sensitivity analysis, Low- and high-cost ranges were finalized to allow
for comparison with overhead electrification.
The financial modelling process is shown in Figure 4-39. Each step in the modelling process will be
reviewed in more details in the sections that follows.

Review of RER Benefit to Cost Ratio Development

The model used for purposes of the feasibility study is the IBC for RER. The IBC model was developed
by a team of Metrolinx staff and consultants in April 2014 in response to the commitment made by the
Province of Ontario to implement RER within a 10-year period. The IBC model outlines the business
case to support RER. Outputs include net benefits, system costs and BCRs. Net benefits explain
whether a scheme is actually worthwhile as a whole, and if it is, by how much. For instance, time
savings to existing and new transit users is a benefit of RER. A complete list of benefits is provided in
the ensuing sections. The BCR also shows how much confidence is required in the accuracy of the
cost and revenue estimates. System costs include capital costs and operating costs, which will be
discussed in detail in the following sections.
The IBC model includes virtually every aspect of the GO rail system and models the impact of
converting the system from a diesel-powered commuter railway to an electric regional express system
that will provide faster, more frequent and all-day services across the Greater Toronto and Hamilton
Area (GTHA). The model includes a financial case (i.e., estimation of capital costs, overheads,
revenues, other income), an economic case (i.e., estimation of benefits), and a deliverability and
operations case (i.e., Union Station, maintenance facilities, and operating and maintenance cost

estimates). The IBC model evaluates benefits and costs associated with five different build-out and
operating scenarios131, including:


Scenario 1: Do Minimum - Peak-focussed limited capital with no electrification.



Scenario 2: Two-Way All-Day - Enhanced diesel service on all corridors with no electrification.



Scenario 3: 10-Year Plan - Frequent service on most inner corridors with limited electrification.



Scenario 4: Full Build (Beyond 10-Year Plan) - Frequent service on all inner corridors with full
electrification.



Scenario 5: Optimized (10-Year Plan Optimized) - Frequent service on most inner corridors with
significant electrification will be achieved under this scenario.

The IBC model evaluates each scenario over 60 years, from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2074.
All monetary values are in 2014 Canadian dollars. Except where otherwise indicated, future values are
presented as net present value (NPV), using a real discount rate of 3.5 percent per year. The model
has provision for escalation of many costs and for some other key assumptions, including train crew
wage rates, diesel fuel, traction electricity, cost of driving, value of time (VOT) and average GO rail
fares. Automobile operating costs are assumed to rise at 0.7 percent per year in real values, while
VOT is assumed to increase at 1.6 percent per year in real values. All benefit and cost figures are
calculated as incremental to the Do Minimum scenario, which forms the base case.
Examples of variables included in the IBC model include project timing, rolling stock and fleet
configurations, train services, network infrastructure and connectivity, track ownership, station and
maintenance facilities, fares, ridership/demand, economic benefits, bus operations, parking, and
others to enable monitoring of economic attractiveness. Figure 4-40 illustrates the modular
construction of the model.

To the extent possible, the IBC model reflects the structure of costs and understanding of passenger
behaviour. Unit rates and total rates of growth, including costs, revenues and productivity factors,
have been calibrated against actual experience, either by GO or by comparable operators.
Infrastructure capital costs are based on recent GO project costs. The IBC model can be used to test
different service options, assumptions and policies.

IBC Model: Capital Costs
Capital cost estimates were completed in 2014 based, wherever possible, on GO’s most recent
project experience. This is the case mostly with track, stations, civil infrastructure (such as bridges),
retaining walls, noise walls, road-rail and rail-rail grade separations, conventional signalling, diesel
locomotives, unpowered bi-level cars and property acquisition. Electrification, electric rolling stock,
and advanced train control prices were based on a range of industry sources, both published and
confidential. Infrastructure costs include engineering costs and contingencies.
As part of RER, many existing stations will require new platforms and, therefore, additional access
tunnels and shelters may be required. In some cases, stations will undergo significant change due to
additional track or realignment for bus interchanges. Passenger pick-up will also require modification
to support increased ridership. Additional property may be required at many station locations. The
model also accounted for increased parking requirements at expanded stations.
For RER, additional tracks are required at various locations on each corridor. Typically, hourly two-way
service requires a passing track, while a full second track is required where trains operate every
15 minutes. A third or fourth track is required where there are express services or where tracks are
shared between two or more services, which may include inter-city rail services and freight services.
In all scenarios, costs to install Positive Train Control (PTC132) signalling systems on new track were
included. PTC is a set of highly advanced safety technologies designed automatically stop a train
before certain types of accidents occur. It was also noted that, although not yet a legal requirement in
Canada, systems similar to PTC are installed on many RER systems, and were required on passenger
rail routes in the U.S. at the time of publishing the report.
Union Station is the heart of the GO network, and will continue to be the main destination for peak
commuters from across the GTHA. It is anticipated it will also become a significant interchange point
within the GO rail network and attract greater inbound flows of boarding passengers than is the case
today. Also, there is the potential to attract more trips connecting places on either side of Union
Station, which could be a benefit of running more trains through the station as opposed to
terminating many train routes at Union Station, as is common practice today. Improvements to the
tracks on either side of Union Station and to platform infrastructure will enable the number of trains
RER will schedule to pass through and serve Union Station.

IBC Model: Operating Costs
Operating cost rates were calculated in 2014, mostly from existing GO costs, as determined from
analysis of GO general ledger documents. Costs were calculated based on the service levels as
defined, driven by train crew hours, train kilometres, route kilometres, or vehicle kilometres as
appropriate.
Diesel fuel and traction electricity consumption and costs were estimated based on data presented in
the 2010 GO electrification study and actual GO experience. As with diesel prices, no long-term
change was assumed in electricity prices.
Other operating costs in the IBC include payments to the CN and the CP for track use and dispatching
costs that are calculated from existing charges, adjusted for train-kilometres; rolling stock
maintenance costs that are based on Canadian and U.K. experience, including GO’s existing contract

132 Positive Train Control is a system of functional requirements for monitoring and controlling train movements and is a type of train
protection system.

for the operation of diesel trains; and infrastructure maintenance that includes costs related to track
maintenance, signalling infrastructure, and other fixed infrastructure costs.

IBC Model: Benefits
Most of the benefits were estimated based on the ridership that was forecast on RER. Note that
increments were for future years, with and without RER. In other words, the comparison was between
what the system would look like under Scenario 1 – Do Minimum and the contemplated system
expansion scenarios. Benefits quantified in the IBC model are transport-related benefits that are
categorized as follows:


Time savings to existing and new transit users.



Auto cost savings to drivers switching to transit.



Quality benefits such as improved comfort, convenience and reliability for transit users.



Safety benefits, primarily reduced accident costs.



Crowding benefits to transit users.



Road-user benefits, cost and time savings to motorists from reduced congestion.

The IBC also considered wider economic and environmental benefits, but these were not captured by
the modelling exercise so were not included in the calculation of the BCRs.

IBC Model: Benefit to Cost Ratios
The BCRs provided information to decision makers regarding how the overall benefits compare to the
overall costs. A ratio greater than one (for example, 2:1) means that the net benefits outweigh the
costs. A ratio less than one (for example, 1:3) means that the costs outweigh the benefits. In the IBC
model, the ratios were calculated by dividing the incremental benefits of a given scenario by the
incremental costs of a given scenario.
The magnitude of the result also communicated important information about the confidence that
decision makers can have in the result. If the BCR is, for example, 3:1, then decision makers can have a
high level of confidence that a scenario is beneficial. The actual costs would have to be three times
higher, or revenues or other benefits one-third of what is expected, before the scenario would prove
not to be beneficial. If the estimated BCR is close to 1:1, then any cost overrun or ridership shortfall
could bring the result below 1:1, making the scenario as proposed not worthwhile.

IBC Model: Cost Factors
As outlined previously inTable 4-29, the IBC applied several cost factors and contingencies to the
capital costs for overhead electrification. These cost factors include:


A cost factor for Environmental Assessment, Engineering and Design that is 15 percent of base
capital costs.



A construction contingency for the on-corridor infrastructure that is 50 percent of base capital
costs.



A productivity and resource cost factor that is 25 percent of base capital costs for on-corridor
infrastructure.



A construction contingency on system-wide infrastructure components of 50 percent of base
capital costs

Result of the IBC
The analysis of BCRs in the IBC resulted in the recommendation that Metrolinx proceed with
Scenario 5. Scenario 5 was subsequently adopted by the Province as the plan for RER. Under
Scenario 5, GO would operate all-day services every 15 minutes to Aldershot, Mount Pleasant, Aurora,
Unionville and Oshawa and introduce electrification to Bramalea, Barrie, Stouffville and Pearson
Airport. Electric trains would replace diesels on some or all of the Lakeshore East and West, Kitchener,
Barrie, and Stouffville lines. Under this scenario, the Milton and Richmond Hill lines would continue to
operate at peak times only, using diesel locomotives.

Key Characteristics of Cost Estimation
According to the cost estimating and assessment guide published by the United States Government
Accountability Office (GAO), a cost estimate should have certain basic characteristics as listed in
Table 4-31.

Description


Estimator must be provided with the system description, ground rules and
assumptions, and technical and performance characteristics



Estimate's constraints and conditions must be clearly identified to ensure the
preparation of a well-documented estimate

The Cost Estimating Process
At the feasibility stage of project evaluation, it is important to understand how a cost estimate is
developed to understand the level of certainty associated with that estimate; this process is illustrated
on Figure 4-41.

The first step involved in cost estimating is defining the estimate’s purpose. At this stage, the project
team will also define the required level of detail and the overall scope of the costing exercise. Cost
estimates have two general purposes: (1) to assist in the evaluation of affordability of a project or
program and to inform the selection of alternative systems and solutions, and (2) to support the
budget process by providing estimates of the funding required to execute a program134.
In the case of the Hydrail feasibility study, the cost estimate serves both purposes; it is designed
primarily to assist in the evaluation of alternative solutions but will also contribute to an understanding
of the potential budget implications of a Hydrail System over the life of the service. All costs directly
related to electrification with Hydrail were modelled and updated in the IBC model. All other costs,
including station improvements, were excluded from the Hydrail costing exercise.
The second step involved in the estimating process is the development of an estimating plan. For
Hydrail, this involved the use of specialist teams to develop cost estimates for the hydrogen related
components of the system. These estimates were then incorporated into IBC model.
The next five steps (steps three through seven) are the beginning of an iterative process that leads to
a point estimate of the program cost. The details of these steps are described in Table 4-32.

The eighth step in the estimating process involves a sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis is
designed to reveal how the cost estimate is affected by a change in a single assumption. The cost
estimator must examine the effect of changing one assumption or cost driver at a time while holding
all other variables constant. By doing so, it is easier to understand which variable most affects the cost
estimate. In some cases, a sensitivity analysis can be conducted to examine the effect of multiple
assumptions changing in relation to a specific scenario.
Regardless of whether the analysis is performed on only one cost driver or several within a single
scenario, the difference between sensitivity analysis and risk or uncertainty analysis is that sensitivity
analysis tries to isolate the effects of changing one variable at a time, while risk or uncertainty analysis
examines the effects of many variables changing all at once.
The sensitivity analysis can be useful for identifying areas where more design research could result in
less production cost or where increased performance could be implemented without substantially
increasing cost.136 For Hydrail, sensitivity analysis was used to narrow focus on the variables that had
the largest impact on the cost of the Hydrail program; these variables were subsequently reviewed in
further detail to refine the estimate of the cost input.
The final step in the estimating process is the risk and uncertainty analysis. Because cost estimates are
a prediction of future program costs, uncertainty is always associated with them. For example, data
from the past may not always be relevant in the future, because new manufacturing processes may
change a learning curve slope or new composite materials may change the relationship between
weight and cost. Regulatory conditions can also impact costs. Moreover, a cost estimate is usually
composed of many lower-level WBS elements, each of which comes with its own source of error.
Once these elements are added together, the resulting cost estimate can contain a great deal of
uncertainty.137 This step of the estimating process involves evaluating the risk and uncertainty
associated with a project and incorporating the potential cost of this risk and uncertainty into the total
cost estimate.
Risk and uncertainty reflect the fact that, because a cost estimate is a forecast, there is always a chance
that the actual cost will differ from the estimate. Lack of knowledge about the future is only one
possible reason for the difference. Another equally important reason is the error resulting from
historical data inconsistencies, assumptions, cost estimating equations, and factors typically used to
develop an estimate.138
In the early phases of any program, knowledge about how well technology will perform, whether the
estimates are unbiased, and how external events may affect the program is imperfect. To enable good
decision making, the program estimate must reflect the degree of uncertainty.139
Estimates are more uncertain at the beginning of a project because less is known about the detailed
requirements and the opportunity for change is great. As the project progresses, requirements
become better defined and risk better understood. As this happens, costs become more certain. In
many cases, costs also increase as project development progresses due to a better understanding of
additional requirements translating into previously unforeseen costs. This progression is illustrated in
Figure 4-42.

FIGURE 4-42 CHANGES IN COST ESTIMATE UNCERTAINTY ACROSS THE PROJECT DEVELOPMENT
LIFECYCLE140

It is typical to use four classes to represent the level of design, and associated uncertainty, at different
project stages. These classes are defined as follows:


Class A (Detailed Design - 100 percent design) estimates are pre-tender estimates, based on
completed construction drawings and detailed specifications contained in tender documents. The
expected precision of the estimate ranges from -5 percent to +10 percent of the actual contract
price.



Class B (Design Development - 67 percent design) estimates are design estimates based on an
advanced project design. They are based on design drawings, project specifications and include
detail on the design of electrical, mechanical and IT systems, as well as site requirements. The
expected precision of the estimate ranges from -10 percent to +15 percent of the actual contract
price.



Class C (Schematic Design - 33 percent design) is a planning level estimate usually based on a
Schematic Design and presented in Elemental Format (a budget setting format/technique which
considers the major elements of a project and provides an order of cost estimate based on an
Elemental Cost Analysis of a building project). These estimates establish a preliminary budget
estimate and a baseline against which project costs will be assessed at future project development
milestones. The expected precision of the estimate ranges from -15 percent to +20 percent of the
actual contract price.



Class D (Conceptual Design) estimates are conceptual estimates based on the project scope (the
work that needs to be accomplished to deliver the project) and functional requirements (the
output specifications/deliverables of a project), and are usually presented in unit cost analysis
format (applying a monetary rate to an element, subelement or component per unit of
measurement). The expected precision of the estimate ranges from -20 percent to +30 percent of
the actual contract price.141

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

The current simulation model could be considered a Class D estimate, with an expected accuracy that
ranges from -20 percent to +30 percent of the actual costs. It is expected that the accuracy of the
estimate would improve should the feasibility study for Hydrail lead to a decision to move the project
to the next stage of development. The technology development process that is proceeding in parallel
to this study will further improve the accuracy and reduce the uncertainty of estimate. Estimating
accuracy improves significantly and the uncertainty in cost estimation reduces to a few percentage
points of the actual costs by the time the detail design is complete and the project is ready for
procurement and implementation.
It is important to continually update cost estimates so that decision makers have has the best
information available for making informed decisions. These processes are illustrated in what is
commonly called the Cone of Uncertainty shown on Figure 4-43.
FIGURE 4-43 CONE OF UNCERTAINTY

Development of Contingencies
Contingencies for infrastructure projects represent a mark-up applied to the base construction cost to
account for uncertainties in quantities, and unit costs. Contingencies are also included to capture risk
events during construction.142
At various stages of the estimating process it is possible to represent the uncertainty implications of
various cost estimates using a cumulative probability distribution curve or an S-curve as illustrated in
Figure 4-44.

FIGURE 4-44 SAMPLE CUMULATIVE DISTRIBUTION CURVE FOR A PROJECT ESTIMATE (FROM THE US
GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE COST ESTIMATING AND ASSESSMENT GUIDE, 2009)

The contingency then is the difference between the estimated cost and the budget to achieve a
certain confidence interval. This concept is illustrated in the following example:
The cumulative probability distribution curve provided in Figure 4-44 considers a hypothetical project
with an estimated cost of $825,000. The uncertainty analysis has revealed that this estimate represents
the 40th percentile meaning that there is a 60 percent chance that costs will be greater than the
estimate. Based on this analysis, a decision could be made to increase the project budget to achieve
greater certainty that the project cost will fall within the budgeted amount. For example, if the budget
for this project was increased from $825,000 to $1,096,000 then there would be a 70 percent
probability that project costs would fall within the budgeted amount. The $271,000 difference
between the estimated cost and the budgeted $1,096,000 represents the construction contingency in
this example.143
The level of confidence used to develop the contingency reflects organizational decisions on the level
of risk that is acceptable.

Limitations
Given the relatively short time frame for the Hydrail analysis, there are some elements of the cost
estimate that have not been completed to the level of detail that could be completed with further
study. These elements of the cost estimate that have not been addressed in the Hydrail simulation
model are outlined as follows:
1. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS): A WBS defines in detail the components necessary to
accomplish a program’s objectives. A WBS can be thought of as an illustration of which tasks will
be accomplished and which components will be delivered to satisfy a program’s requirements.
The WBS diagrams the effort in small, discrete pieces, or elements, to show how each one relates
to the others and to the program as a whole.
The number of levels for a WBS varies from program to program and depends on a program’s
complexity and risk. WBSs need to be expanded to a level of detail sufficient for planning and
successfully managing the full scope of work. However, each WBS should, at the very least, include
three levels:


The first level represents the program as a whole so contains only one element—the program’s
name.



The second level contains the major program segments.



Level three contains the lower-level components or subsystems for each segment.

A sample WBS for a process plant construction144 is shown in Table 4-33 for illustration.

Although a detailed WBS has not been developed for this study, different elements of the Hydrail
System have been discussed, and individual components have been identified for costing. The
WBS example does, however, provide some insight into additional costs not currently covered by
the Hydrail simulation, such as legal and regulatory expenses, testing, startup, and project
management expenses. These costs are known elements of a construction project, and although
they may not be accurately modelled in the feasibility study stage, they should be recognized in
the model, and carefully considered when making a decision based on the findings of the analysis.
These cost elements should not be captured under contingencies. By definition, contingency is an
allowance for unknown factors that may result in higher project costs, so it should not include cost
elements that are known but are absent in the cost estimate.
2. Risk analysis: The methodology for developing construction contingencies discussed involves the
use of probabilistic analysis of risk and uncertainty (that is, the contingency represents a markup
applied to the base construction cost to account for uncertainties in quantities and unit costs, and
is defined as the difference between the base cost estimate and the budget to achieve a certain
confidence interval). The confidence interval also depends on decision-makers’ risk appetites. At
this stage in the modelling exercise, contingency amounts have been based on the IBC and on the
technical expertise of the modelling team. At later stages of the exercise, a quantitative risk
assessment will result in a more refined contingency that can be carried into construction and
operations phases of the program.

4.4.3.1 Hydrail Analysis
For purposes of this study, the first stage of the financial analysis involved comparing the anticipated
costs associated with Hydrail to those for overhead electrification, using the IBC model. Costs that are
common to both technologies (for example, track and station improvements) were held constant. Key
assumptions (for example, discount rate) were also held constant where reasonable, and adjusted
where necessary. As an example, assumptions regarding service patterns—the key driver behind
revenues and benefits of RER—were assumed to be equal under both technologies. As such, this part
of the study is predicated on an assumption that a Hydrail System would deliver the same level of
service as overhead electrification, as is discussed in Section 4.2.2. Inputs that would change (for
example, a new cost associated with the production of hydrogen and removal of capital costs
associated with overhead electrification) were the focus of the analysis. This allows for a like-for-like

analysis of Hydrail relative to Scenario 5 electrification, and mimics going back in time and adding
Hydrail as an additional scenario for RER in the 2014 analysis. However, as will be shown in this
section, a true like-for-like analysis requires updating certain IBC assumptions to reflect those used for
Hydrail.
As service levels are assumed to be the same, net benefits of the program as captured in the IBC
model do not change under a Hydrail scenario for RER. For purposes of the BCR, benefits are driven
by ridership of the RER system and because ridership is assumed to be the same for Hydrail the
benefits remain constant. There are numerous potential benefits and risks associated with both
overhead electrification and Hydrail that are not captured in the first stage of the IBC analysis. Some
are, however, discussed later in this section and in Section 4.7 where the broader social, economic
and environmental benefits are discussed. Later in this section, the financial analysis will further
examine the impact of Hydrail on capital and operating costs over the lifespan of the RER program,
including sensitivity analysis and potential fiscal impacts to the province.
It should be noted that within the cost items that were considered common to both technologies
there are certain elements that are likely to change between the Hydrail and overhead electric
systems. One example is the cost of property purchases currently considered in the IBC. Part of this
line item represents the cost to purchase land to develop substations that would be required for an
overhead contact system. Such costs would not, however, be required for Hydrail. Conversely,
additional land may be required to service Hydrail vehicles (for example, to replace hydrogen tanks at
specified service intervals) and may have an impact on land requirements within maintenance yards.
However, because the breakdown of cost items like this are not fully understood they have been
carried forward in the Hydrail simulation. Should the feasibility study lead to a decision to continue to
examine Hydrail, more detailed analysis of these costs would be required to provide a full picture of
the cost of each system.
The outputs from the Hydrail System simulation described previously were used to develop a
schedule of Hydrail costs for incorporation into the IBC model. The key cost drivers for the Hydrail
simulation were reviewed and highest and lowest values for these variables were developed. The
ranges for these variables are presented in Table 4-34.

These highest and lowest case values were used to develop a high-cost scenario (where all the
variables were set at worst case levels) and a low-cost scenario (where all the variables were set at best
case levels) for Hydrail. These labels are not intended to apply any judgment of one technology over
another. The values were then used to develop new costs for electrification-related capital cost items,

electrification-related operating cost items, and fleets costs. All other costs described above (for
example, station expansions, signalling) are held constant. All real costs used in the analysis are in
2014 dollars.
The high end and low end for electricity price is estimated using IESO data and an optimized
hydrogen production schedule developed by the technical team. For further details, please refer to
Section 4.3.

4.4.3.2 Application of Cost Factors in the Hydrail Model
As discussed above, contingencies are a key part of the IBC model and, taken together, represent 90
percent of total capital costs. For Hydrail, the approach followed was to carry forward contingencies
and make adjustments based on several factors. First, the cost factor for Environmental Assessment,
Engineering and Design was increased from 15 percent to 30 percent for Hydrail. The application of
HFC technology in the rail industry is still relatively untested (as discussed elsewhere in this report). As
such it is reasonable to assume that the percentage of capital costs applied for engineering and
design should be higher than what was used to model a traditional overhead electric system through
the IBC model. This contingency only applies to initial capital investment and falls to 0 percent as
Hydrail assets need to be replaced or refurbished, reflecting the fact that expertise and experience
will have grown to a point where such events are highly predictable in terms of costs and risks.
Construction contingencies in the IBC model account for uncertainty associated with the cost of the
development and construction of a complex electrified rail system. In the IBC model, the construction
cost contingency for overhead electrification was 50 percent of estimated capital costs. This
contingency has been applied to all civil infrastructure and electrification base costs within the IBC
model. For purposes of this financial analysis, construction cost contingencies used in the IBC model
have been carried forward for Hydrail without change. A 50 percent contingency is reasonable for
capital undertakings where an organization has little experience, in this case signalling, for
electrification, and for the development of hydrogen-powered vehicles. Furthermore, the risk
associated with deploying a new application of a technology at the scale that would be required for
Hydrail, including establishing an entirely new supply chain for the production, transportation and
dispensing of hydrogen, further justifies inclusion of this contingency. Additionally, the contingency is
meant to capture costs that are currently not well understood for both the overhead and electrification
costs – these costs include things like financing costs, operator profit, taxes, and permitting fees.
Finally, a productivity and resource cost factor is applied to the on-corridor infrastructure for overhead
electrification and to all hydrogen related infrastructure for the Hydrail System (in addition to oncorridor infrastructure required for both systems). This cost factor is intended to capture the additional
costs associated with the construction of the RER system in a shorter time frame and more complex
environment than what is typical for similar projects. The productivity and resource factor is applied to
on-corridor infrastructure base costs to account for construction under increased rail traffic conditions
and ongoing service expansions, and includes consideration of limited specialized resources in the
industry (particularly for electrification and hydrogen technologies). This factor has not been applied
to system-wide costs like enhanced train control and maintenance facilities. The productivity and cost
resource factor applied to the overhead electrical system in the IBC is 25 percent and it is understood
that much of this factor accounts for the complexity of installing the overhead infrastructure during live
rail operations meaning much of the work will have to take place overnight, for example. This same
constraint does not exist for Hydrail implementation as capital works would likely not significantly
impact operations on the rail corridor. A potential advantage of Hydrail is the ability to roll out fleet
incrementally and intermingled with existing rolling stock. It is difficult to predict with accuracy at this
stage of the project if there might be disruptions or complications associated with a mixed-fuel fleet,

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

or the impact construction of hydrogen production and fuelling stations might have on current
operations. As a result, the productivity and cost resource factor for Hydrail has been reduced from
25 percent to 10 percent.
Further refinement is necessary to the cost factors to account for the life cycle of electrification and
Hydrail capital assets. Hydrail will require CAPEX throughout the life of the RER program to replace,
either fully or partially, components of the system like the fuel cells and on-board storage tanks. This
contrasts with overhead electrification where a large upfront CAPEX is expected but, based on the long
life-span of these capital components, ongoing expenditures have been assumed within IBC to be
limited to routine maintenance as opposed to system-wide replacement. While there are ongoing
CAPEX as part of Hydrail, it is expected that there will be greater cost certainty and potential design and
production cost savings as the Hydrail program ages and the technology matures. As such, the cost
escalation factors that are applied to initial CAPEX in the overhead electrification case and the Hydrail
case are not applied to the on-going expenditures related to the replacement or refurbishment of
Hydrail specific capital components. Cost factors discussed in this section are summarized in Table 4-35.

Sensitivity Analysis

Following the development of the capital and operating costs for the Hydrail System, a sensitivity
analysis was performed to quantify the impact of each individual variable on the be BCR using the
following approach:


All cost variables were set at their high case values to establish a baseline for comparison (that is,
the high scenario).



Each variable was then individually changed to its lowest case while keeping all other variables
unchanged.



The NPV of the following outputs were recorded for each iteration:





Total CAPEX = total initial capital + total replacement cost



Total OPEX = total operating cost + total maintenance cost

The change in NPV was calculated and sorted from highest to lowest.

The sensitivity analysis shows that three variables result in largest variation in the NPV of the selected
outputs:


Cost of electricity



Lifetime of fuel cell



Price of fuel cell

The sensitivity analysis shows that all other variables have a negligible effect (that is, below 2 percent)
on the output parameters. The outputs from the sensitivity analysis are presented in Table 4-36. This
analysis was used to guide the modelling team to the variables that require the most precision and
that warrant the most in-depth analysis through conversations with industry and research.

Model Benchmarking

In addition to the financial analysis presented in this section, the hydrogen pricing model was
compared to publicly available case studies. This exercise provides a benchmark for the result of the
modelling exercise used in Hydrail feasibility study.
Several key technologies for producing hydrogen were studied by the H2A145 team with expertise in
design and advancement of these technologies within the United States Department of Energy
Hydrogen and Fuel Cells Program146. One case study covers future estimates for central hydrogen
production using PEM technology. The model inputs were modified to match requirements of the
Hydrail project (that is, total hydrogen production, price of electricity, unit cost of electrolyzer and
total capacity installed), as shown in Table 4-37.

The results of the two models are categorized as follows:


Capital costs: total capital cost estimated under the DOE model is approximately $30 million
(19 percent) higher than those estimated by the Hydrail simulation. This is because some up-front
costs (including permitting and legal costs), as well as site preparation costs, are not included in
the Hydrail simulation model. It is important to note, however, that the two models produce
comparable results for direct capital costs.



Operating costs: maintenance costs are estimated to be higher in the DOE model than in the
Hydrail simulation model by approximately $2.5 million per year. The DOE model yields a result
for operating costs that is very close to the Hydrail simulation model (4 percent variance).

This analysis shows that the cost of hydrogen production (which is represented as $ per kg of
hydrogen produced) is 20 percent lower in the Hydrail simulation model than the DOE model for the
following reasons:




Approximately half of the difference is driven by the indirect capital costs. The following cost
elements have not been captured in the Hydrail simulation model:


Site preparation cost



Permitting and legal costs

The remaining half is driven by financing costs and taxes associated with producing hydrogen that
are not currently captured in the Hydrail simulation model. These costs include:


Initial equity depreciable capital;



Cash for working capital reserve;

Results of the Hydrail Modelling Exercise

The process discussed above outlines a systematic method for developing cost estimates. This
process was used to develop, refine, and understand the cost estimate for the Hydrail System and
how this estimate compares to the cost estimates for overhead electrification as presented in the 2014
IBC model.
The IBC analysis resulted in a BCR of 3.07 for overhead electrification (Scenario 5). The update to the
IBC model for Hydrail results in a BCR of 3.01 under the low-cost scenario and 2.65 under the highcost scenario. According to this analysis, the costs of Hydrail and overhead electrification appear to be
comparable in the low-cost scenario and the overall benefits continue to outweigh the costs of the
system in all scenarios.
Table 4-39 provides a high-level overview of the 60-year NPV costs and BCRs under the traditional
overhead, and low, and high scenarios for Hydrail.

Under both (D) and (E), initial capital (that is, capital spent during the construction or development
phase of RER) and ongoing capital (that is, capital spent once the RER program is operational) are
included as separate items. The intention is to illustrate the difference between overhead electrification
and Hydrail as it relates to the distribution of spending over the lifetime of the RER program.
When undertaking a like-for-like analysis through the IBC model, Hydrail shows a slight to moderate
disadvantage when compared to overhead electric. This suggests higher costs will be observed
throughout the life of the RER program. Under a low scenario the model shows only a small decline in
the BCR between when compared to the overhead electrification case. Conversely, if a costlier
scenario materializes (for example, electricity prices are higher in 2040 than expected), the outcome
could impact into reduced BCR for Hydrail. The sensitivity analysis suggests that there are three
factors that will have the most significant impact on cost. In order of importance these are: price of
electricity; lifespan of fuel cells; and cost of fuel cells. Given the potential impact on the final results,
these are the items where further analysis should focus.
It is important to emphasize that the costs contained throughout the models (including IBC) are not
intended to reflect the price to install and manage the system under a typical commercial
arrangement. Such information would only be clearly understood following a market sounding
exercise followed by a competitive procurement process.
Other Benefits of Hydrail
Other benefits of Hydrail (for example, establishing a hydrogen economy, local jobs) have been captured
by a separate modelling exercise within the feasibility study. The socio-economic study examines:


Employment and GDP benefits



A reduction in disruption related to the construction of an overhead system in a live rail corridor.



The potential to develop a 'hydrogen economy' in the province that could spur the deployment of
hydrogen for other applications.



Supporting deployment of hydrogen for commercial use in transportation (for example,
passenger vehicles, buses, commercial vehicle).



The opportunity to support development of hydrogen based energy storage systems, which will
facilitate the increased use of renewable energy in Ontario's electricity system w harness surplus
energy

4.4.7

Updates to the IBC

Metrolinx is currently in the process of updating the cost estimate for overhead electrification that was
developed as part of the IBC. As discussed earlier in this chapter, during early stages of a project, where
the design of a system is still in initial stages of development, large variability can be expected in cost
estimates. As more detailed design is completed, costs are better understood and, in many cases, rise as a
better understanding of the project often reveals costs not previously accounted for.
Based on the update to overhead electrification costs currently underway, it appears that costs for
overhead electrification will be higher than estimated in the IBC. The updated costs will not be
finalized until after the completion of the Hydrail feasibility study and, therefore, these updates are not
reflected in this analysis.
Based on the work currently ongoing to update the cost estimate for overhead electrification there is
an expectation that CAPEX and OPEX will be higher than envisioned in the IBC. Adjusting for these
higher costs, the BCR in the IBC could fall below 3.07, as is currently captured by the IBC model.

The estimated BCR for Hydrail may also change due to refinements in the technical model or changes
to electricity policies. As illustrated in Figure 4-45, further modelling work may result in greater
hydrogen required for the Hydrail System, which could result in increased capital and operating costs.
Consequently, the BCR would be reduced from 2.65 as currently estimated in the high-cost case. On
the other hand, an electricity policy change that results in lower electricity prices will improve the BCR
from 3.01 as currently estimated in the low-cost case.
It is however noted that any future electricity policy change that results in lower electricity prices could
also improve the BCR for the overhead electrification case.

Other Considerations

It is also important to note that there are several key considerations that are not captured by the IBC
analysis that are critical to the overall business case and a decision on the technology that should be
used to electrify the GO network. These considerations as discussed below include potential benefits
from Hydrail, areas where it is unclear whether there is a benefit or a risk, and risks associated with
deployment of Hydrail.
First, the IBC model work likely does not completely account for the value of the risk associated with
constructing an overhead electric system in a live rail corridor. Although an adjustment has been
made to the Productivity and Resource cost factor to reflect reduced complexity associated with the
construction of a Hydrail System, this adjustment likely does not fully capture the entire value of
avoided risk that would be inherent to installing an overhead contact system on a live rail corridor,
something that is rarely done in the rail industry.
Second, Hydrail may present an opportunity to more gradually deploy HFC-powered train sets and to
potentially achieve this roll out with little to no disruption to existing rail operations. RER service levels
are currently scheduled to begin in 2024 accordingly, this is when additional operating costs begin
and related benefits are expected to be realized. If Hydrail is deployed, commencement of RER

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

services may not be binary as is the case for overhead electrification. As Hydrail vehicles are delivered
to Metrolinx, it may be possible to deploy these vehicles on a portion of the GO network before
bringing the entire system online. This could potentially allow RER benefits to be realized earlier than
would be the case through overhead electrification. While this phased roll-out could help to realize
additional benefits, it could also increase operational complexity as some lines would be operating at
significantly increased service levels and speeds that may be difficult to coordinate with slower routes
through Union Station. This potential benefit could also be negated because of the need to develop a
hydrogen supply chain across the GO network. Further analysis will need to be undertaken to
understand if there may be regulatory, safety, operational or commercial considerations that may
hinder ability to seamlessly deploy a mixed fleet of hydrogen and diesel train sets as is assumed in
making this statement.
Third, the IBC model work likely does not sufficiently capture the comparison between maintenance
requirements of the two systems. While in concept, maintenance of fuel cells can be done without
significant disruption, the entire maintenance regime for a Hydrail train is not fully understood. In
some cases, manufacturers may require that maintenance is undertaken by their own trained
workforce, or a workforce with certain credentials. This could introduce operational complexities if, for
example, different workers are needed to maintain various components of the hydrogen system. The
maintenance cycle may be further complicated by regulatory requirements associated with, for
example, replacement of tanks and how the system is safety tested after such events. Furthermore, the
amount of downtime associated with servicing Hydrail vehicles compared to traditional electric
vehicles is unknown. This could impact the configuration of maintenance facilities and the size of the
fleet. The key point is not that the costs will be higher, but that maintenance requirements will be
more complex and will require different processes to be followed, potential impacts on facilities and
fleet, and likely a higher skilled workforce. The specific nature of these differences is unknown and has
not been quantified through the IBC model.
Forth, it is reasonable to assume that accreditation requirements of those undertaking work on the
hydrogen related components of the trains will likely be more stringent than for those servicing
traditional electric vehicles. The potential for limited availability of technicians to service the Hydrail
System is not captured by the Hydrail System model. Specialized technicians will be required to
service Hydrail vehicles and this is expertise that does not currently exist in Ontario at the scale that
would be required. The lack of a skilled workforce could lead to higher costs at the outset as the
industry trains technicians. To meet demand, the Province of Ontario may need to invest in
educational programs to develop this skilled workforce. Development of a new work force has
potential long-term benefits for the Ontario economy. These benefits are discussed in Section 4.7 this
study. The key point is that the lack of a skilled workforce introduces risk to the deployment of Hydrail
that would need to be overcome to ensure a smooth transition into service.
Fifth, a significant potential benefit of Hydrail is the opportunity it presents to electrify more of the go
RER network than would otherwise be possible through overhead electrification. This includes
electrification of the outer areas of the network where overhead electrification would be cost
prohibitive, and also to electrify corridors that the IBC model assumes would continue to run diesel
service over the course of the 60 year RER program. Broader electrification could mean increased
ridership as services will be more frequent and faster and associated increases to the overall benefits
associated with the RER program. These benefits would be realized assuming agreements to operate
HFC-powered trains can be negotiated in areas of the GO network that are not owned by Metrolinx.
Sixth, while Hydrail related costs have been modelled, there is inherent uncertainty in such processes.
On one hand, it is difficult to predict the extent to which capital and operating costs could come down
in the future in light of a potential surge in establishing hydrogen economies globally. This would

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

come through increased competition, more real-world cases of implementation, and likely more
research funding going into the technology. Similarly, it is very difficult to predict with accuracy the
impact Hydrail could have on future energy prices in Ontario. Modelling work that has been
undertaken is based on Ontario’s current energy outlook. It is well-understood that the outlook is
based on one scenario where disruptions like mass deployment of electrical vehicles or significant
downturns in the economy have not been assumed. As explained in Section 4.3, the load presented
by Hydrail could lead to an increase in the wholesale price of electricity during the periods electricity
is demanded by the Hydrail System. This will be the case if a situation arises where the availability of
surplus baseload significantly declines due to increased adoption of electric vehicles and potentially
increased use of electricity for home heating as is contemplated in Ontario’s Climate Change Action
Plan.
Seventh, Hydrail has the potential to be an anchor point for Ontario’s hydrogen economy. Lack of
infrastructure is regularly sited as the key barrier to wide spread adoption of hydrogen technologies.
The scale of Hydrail could provide that essential backbone that is needed to make hydrogen a viable
technology option for commercial and personal transportation and for other purposes. To make this a
reality, the hydrogen supply chain for Hydrail would likely need to be purposely designed and
procured to ensure the broader potential benefits are realized. If, as an example, the fuelling network
was purposely built for Hydrail, those broader benefits may be missed. Should a hydrogen supply
chain be established and anchored in a long-term agreement for the provision of a certain amount of
hydrogen to supply the Hydrail System, and that system also is used for other commercial
applications, the price could be significantly different. The Hydrail analysis does not capture the
potential benefits associated with such arrangements. Related to this point, Hydrail has the potential
to facilitate continued efforts to decarbonize Ontario’s electricity system and to support continued
installation of renewable energy production capabilities as it provides a storage medium that is not
currently available. As per above, this would require that the hydrogen supply chain is effectively
open for purposes broader than Hydrail.
Finally, it is very difficult to quantify the risk associated with deployment of Hydrail at the scale that
would be required to replace plans for overhead electrification. While all aspects associated with the
production, storage, dispensing and use of hydrogen in fuel cells has been proven internationally, it
has not been accomplished in a rail setting at anywhere near the scale being contemplated in Ontario
and it has yet to be tested on rail vehicles that are comparable in terms of size and weight to what
would be required to meet RER service levels as contemplated in the IBC.

4.4.9

Fiscal Analysis

I It is important to note that although the NPV of the cost of both systems appear to be similar, there
are significant differences in the timing of expenditures. For the overhead system, it is expected that
much of the capital cost will be incurred near the beginning of the project as the overhead contact
system is constructed. For Hydrail, however, the initial capital cost is expected to be lower but the
recurring CAPEX to refurbish or replace hydrogen equipment is expected to be higher than for the
overhead system.
The combined impact of capital investment and operating and maintenance costs (i.e., the fiscal
analysis) is analyzed in this section as separate operating and capital cost results that were presented
in the previous sections do not clearly show how the investment affects annual budgets. A fiscal
analysis has been completed with respect to the following four categories:


Amortized cost: annual amortization cost of capital assets. The effect of initial capital investment
will appear in the books under the amortized cost of investment. It is assumed that initial capital
investment for overhead electrification will be amortized linearly over 50 years (that is, from 2024

to 2074). Hydrail’s initial capital, however, will be depreciated at different rates depending on the
asset type. For instance, fuel cells have a significantly higher depreciation rate comparing to
storage tanks due to their shorter life span. Components of the Hydrail System were depreciated
at the rates shown in Table 4-40.

Cost of financing: annual cost of debt. It is assumed that the initial capital investment is fully
financed by debt. The debt is assumed to be issued at a rate of 3.5 percent annually, maturing in
30 years for both overhead electrification and Hydrail.



Operating cost: annual cost of electricity. As explained in Section 4.3, the volume and unit cost of
electricity was estimated using data provided by IESO and the Hydrail simulation model. The average
annual operating costs for the first 10 years of operation was then estimated for comparison.



Maintenance cost: annual maintenance cost. The maintenance cost for Hydrail was derived from
the Hydrail simulation model.

The result of the fiscal analysis is presented in Table 4-41. The difference between total annual costs of
overhead electrification and low- and high-cost Hydrail scenarios is also presented in Table 4-41.
Under the low-cost scenario, Hydrail would result in an average decrease of $31 million in
Government’s expenses over the first 10 years of operations. Under high-cost scenario, Hydrail would
result in an average increase of $55 million over the same operating period.

develop a final conclusion on the fiscal impact of the implementation of the overhead electric and
Hydrail systems.

4.4.10 Findings
The comparison between Hydrail and overhead electrification, as envisioned in the IBC, illustrates
based on the information available, that total capital and operating costs for Hydrail are either similar
more costly than overhead electrification. In both the low- and high-cost cases for Hydrail, total
operating costs are expected to be higher than for an overhead system, as estimated in 2014.
The higher capital cost for the Hydrail System is primarily driven by the requirement for more frequent
CAPEX required to replace the assets in the Hydrail System, due to the shorter lifespan of the assets.
In the low-cost scenario, the higher ongoing capital requirement is counter-balanced by lower initial
capital required in the Hydrail System.
Although an attempt has been made to understand and account for the variability in cost estimates
that is inherent at the feasibility-testing stage, it remains important to emphasize the uncertainty in
both the cost estimates for Hydrail and for overhead electrification. While the BCRs for Hydrail and
overhead electrification are similar, with overhead electrification showing only marginally lower costs
than Hydrail under the low-cost scenario, further design is required to advance the cost estimate of
both systems to allow for a complete picture of the cost difference.
The findings presented are based on NPV estimation. An attempt has been made to translate the
analysis into fiscal terms because the government’s decision-making depends heavily on the fiscal
impact of the project. As discussed in Section 4.4.9, the capital and operating costs of the Hydrail
System would result in an overall annual expense ranging between $129 million and $214 million in
the low- and high-cost scenarios, respectively. The variation between the scenarios is primarily driven
by the difference in amortized capital costs that results from higher unit costs and shorter life spans of
the Hydrail System equipment in the high-cost scenario. The annual operating cost also increases
materially as a result of higher cost of electricity considered in the high-cost scenario. This analysis
requires further review and confirmation by the Metrolinx finance team, at which time a comparison
between Hydrail and overhead electrification scenarios could be considered and the associated
impact on capital and operating costs that will be carried in the provincial fiscal plan can be assessed.

4.4.11 Next Steps
As discussed, a more detailed estimate for Hydrail should include costs like permitting and financing
costs, and would also include a more detailed analysis of risk and the risk-related costs; this will
provide a more accurate picture of the total costs of a Hydrail System. At the same time, work should
be completed to update the overhead electrification costs. The IBC was completed in 2014 and,
similar to the requirement for a more detailed assessment of Hydrail related costs, a more detailed
assessment of overhead electrification, based on a more current understanding of costs should be
conducted. This will allow for a more complete comparison of Hydrail and overhead electrification.
Additionally, the focus of the financial modelling process to-date has been the total cost of the Hydrail
and overhead electric systems. This does not represent the price of system to Metrolinx—further
modelling work should consider things like procurement and financing costs to help provide a more
accurate picture of the full financial impact of the development of either system.
Finally, a detailed investigation of the risks associated with both Hydrail and overhead electrification
technologies should be completed. This will contribute to the understanding of the true potential cost
of each project.

Environmental

The objective of this section is to provide a high-level comparative review of the potential impacts of
electrification and Hydrail scenarios. The seven scenarios included in the comparison are summarized
as follows:


Scenario 1, RER Scenario 5: Electric-powered and diesel-powered train fleet mix.



Scenario 2a: Hydrogen-powered and diesel-powered train mix, with hydrogen production and
storage facilities (five) located in industrial areas away from the five Hydrail corridors. Hydrogen
fuel (liquid hydrogen [LH2] or CGH2) would be transported by truck from the hydrogen storage
and production facilities to the dispensing and fuelling facilities located at existing railyards.



Scenario 2b: Hydrogen-powered and diesel-powered train mix, with hydrogen production and
storage facilities (five) located adjacent to each of the five Hydrail corridors. Hydrogen fuel (LH2 or
CGH2) would not require transportation to the existing railyards.



Scenario 2c: Hydrogen-powered and diesel-powered train mix, with hydrogen production and
storage facilities (five) located in industrial areas away from the five Hydrail corridors. Liquid
hydrogen would be transported by a 4-inch outside diameter (OD) steel pipeline from the
hydrogen storage and production facilities to the dispensing and fuelling facilities located at
existing railyards.



Scenario 3a: Full hydrogen-powered train fleet on seven corridors, with hydrogen production and
storage facilities (seven) located in industrial areas away from the rail corridors. Hydrogen fuel (LH2
or CGH2) would be transported by truck from the hydrogen storage and production facilities to
the dispensing and fuelling facilities located at existing railyards.



Scenario 3b: Full hydrogen-powered train fleet on seven corridors, with hydrogen production and
storage facilities (seven) located adjacent to each rail corridor. Hydrogen fuel (LH2 or CGH2) would
not require transportation to the existing railyards.



Scenario 3c: Full hydrogen-powered train fleet on seven corridors, with hydrogen production and
storage facilities (seven) located in industrial areas away from each rail corridor. Liquid hydrogen
would be transported by a 4-inch OD steel pipeline from the hydrogen storage and production
facilities to the dispensing and fuelling facilities located at existing railyards.

Evaluation Methodology

A reasoned argument evaluation methodology was used to compare technology scenarios.
Assessment criteria were selected to correspond with the 11 environmental factors identified in the
GO Rail Network Electrification Transit Project Assessment Process Final Environmental Project Report
(TPAP EPR)147. For each criterion, metrics were defined and environmental effects were assigned to
each of the seven scenarios based on available information. For each criterion, preference was
assigned to the scenarios based on the magnitude of potential or anticipated environmental effect. A
rationale for the preference determination was then provided for each criterion, and for the overall
assessment.

4.5.1.1 Assumptions
The scope of the assessment was based on Scenario 5 of the GO RER Initial Business Case148.
Assumptions from the TPAP EPR were carried over to this assessment and include:


Service levels for the year 2025 and all additional RER infrastructure modifications are already in
place.



Projects outside the scope of the TPAP EPR (for example, new tracks, grade separations, and new
GO stations) would be assessed separately.



Electrification or Hydrail infrastructure implementation is separate from the other planned works;
therefore, the assessment does not evaluate their impacts.



The diesel-Hydrail scenarios (2a-c) will maintain the same fleet mix of diesel and hydrogen trains
as RER Scenario 5 diesel and electric trains.



Implementation timeframes for Scenarios 2 and 3 will be the same as for Scenario 1, 2024.

Assumptions related to Hydrail and associated infrastructure include:


Under Scenario 2, the five rail corridors would be converted to Hydrail; and under Scenario 3, all
seven rail corridors would be converted to Hydrail.



Liquid and compressed hydrogen fuels will have similar impacts at the level of detail assessed.



Central production facilities will be located in existing industrial areas, potentially several
kilometres from each rail corridor, and would require transportation of hydrogen fuel to the
dispensing and refuelling facilities.



Local production and storage facilities will be constructed adjacent to the hydrogen fuel
dispensing and refuelling facility along each rail corridor.



Trucks or pipelines would be used to transport hydrogen fuel from central production and storage
facilities to dispensing and fuelling facilities.



For Scenarios 2a, b, and c, facility footprints for the five hydrogen production and storage facilities
and five dispensing and fuelling facilities will be a total of 10,841 square metres (m2). It was
assumed that liquid and compressed hydrogen facilities would have the same footprints.



For Scenarios 3a, b, and c, facility footprints for the seven hydrogen production and storage
facilities and seven dispensing and fuelling facilities will be a total of 15,144 m2. It was assumed
that liquid and compressed hydrogen facilities would have the same footprints.



Facility footprint assumptions for electrification were based on infrastructure footprints (five hydro
one-tap locations, five traction power substations [TPSs], five switching stations [SWSs], and six
paralleling stations [PSs]) provided in the TPAP EPR. Areas associated with gantries, feeder routes,
bridge modifications or replacements, paralleling barriers, and the overhead contact system were
not included in the facility footprint.



Hydrogen production and storage facilities will have storage for 3 days’ worth of hydrogen.



Hydrogen production facilities can be located in areas designated for industrial use and in visually
unobtrusive areas, and would not be located in sensitive natural habitats or in areas of high

archaeological potential. Facility locations were assumed to have impacts equivalent to those of
electrification facilities.


Electricity for hydrogen production would be sourced from Hydro One through an underground
connection to the facility.



Water for hydrogen production would be sourced from the local water mains.



Use of Hydrail vehicles can be scaled up on the corridors once the production and refuelling
facilities are operational.

4.5.2

Evaluation Results

The comparative evaluation is included in Table 4-42. This section presents a summary of the
preliminary evaluation results, limitations, and additional considerations for future assessment.

4.5.2.1 Terrestrial and Aquatic Ecosystems
For this criterion, Scenarios 2a and 2b are preferred, as they result in the smallest potential footprint
disturbance to vegetation and wildlife habitat, and will not require modifications to existing water
crossings. Scenario 3a and 3b are slightly less preferred, as the footprint of the required hydrogen
production facilities is slightly larger than required for hybrid diesel-hydrogen scenarios. Pipeline
options 2c and 3c may result in additional vegetation removals and watercourse crossings, making
these scenarios less desirable than the other Hydrail scenarios. Electrification is least preferred for this
criterion, as it requires significant right-of-way (ROW) clearing, footprint impacts associated with new
facilities, and construction of new infrastructure in proximity to watercourses, including Redside dace
habitat149.

4.5.2.2 Contaminated Soils and Groundwater
For this criterion, Scenarios 3b and 3c are preferred, as they eliminate the operation of diesel trains
and the requirement to transport hydrogen using diesel trucks. Scenario 2a is least preferred, as a
portion of the transit fleet remains diesel, and the central hydrogen production facility introduces a
requirement for 78 truck trips per day to transport hydrogen to the dispensing and fuelling facilities.

4.5.2.3 Built Heritage
From a built heritage perspective, all Hydrail scenarios avoid the requirement to modify heritage
properties, so are preferred. Scenario 1 is least preferred, as electrification requires modification of up
to 12 heritage properties (bridges).

4.5.2.4 Archaeology
From an archaeological perspective, Hydrail scenarios not involving pipeline construction (2a, 2b,
3a, 3b) are preferred, as they result in the least subsurface disturbance; therefore, they minimize
potential impacts to archaeological resources. Scenarios 2c and 3c are less preferred, as pipeline
construction increases potential to encounter archaeological resources. Electrification is least
preferred, as this scenario requires the most subsurface construction.

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

4.5.2.5 Land Use
Impacts to land use are not anticipated under any scenario. It has been assumed that hydrogen
production facilities can be located in areas designated for industrial use.

4.5.2.6 Emissions
From an emissions perspective, the full Hydrail scenarios (3a, 3b, and 3c) are preferred, as they
eliminate diesel trains from the RER fleet mix and reduce GHG emissions regionally, leading to
improved local air quality. Hydrail Scenarios 2b and 2c, and electrification (Scenario 1) are less
preferred and are assumed to contribute comparable emissions, though less emissions than the
current diesel train fleet. While Hydrail may require up to 3 times more electricity than electrification,
hydrogen production can be carried out at periods of low grid demand, reducing reliance on fossil
fuel sources. Hydrail Scenario 2a is least preferred, as diesel trains remain part of the fleet mix, and the
central hydrogen production facility introduces the requirement for 78 additional truck trips per day.

4.5.2.7 Noise and Vibration
From a noise and vibration perspective, the full Hydrail scenarios (3a, 3b, and 3c) are preferred, as
they eliminate diesel locomotives from the fleet mix. Hydrail locomotives will not have mechanical
engines, reducing the noise produced by the train. Assuming the proportion of diesel trains is
consistent between Scenarios 1, 2a, 2b, and 2c, these scenarios are less preferred.
Significantly more effects from noise and vibration can be expected during construction of
electrification infrastructure along the rail corridors and at facilities. A comparison of impacts would
require additional siting information and construction methodology for electrification and Hydrail
scenarios.

4.5.2.8 Visual and Aesthetics
From a visual perspective, Hydrail scenarios featuring a central production facility, pipeline, or both
(2a, 2c, 3a, 3c) are preferred, as they do not require overhead infrastructure; and there is flexibility to
site production facilities in visually unobtrusive locations (such as in industrial areas). Scenarios 2b and
2c are less preferred, as it is assumed that localized production facilities may be located in highly
visible or residential areas. Electrification is least preferred due to the requirement for extensive
overhead infrastructure.

4.5.2.9 Utilities
From a utilities perspective, Hydrail scenarios not requiring pipeline installation (2a, 2b, 3a, 3c) are
preferred, as they avoid potential for utility conflicts within road and rail ROWs. Scenarios 2c and 3c
are less preferred, as pipeline installation increases the potential for utility conflicts. Electrification is
least preferred, as extensive infrastructure required within the ROW is expected to result in significant
utility conflicts.

4.5.2.10 Electromotive Force
According to the TPAP EPR150, electromotive force (EMF) impacts are not anticipated. No impacts are
anticipated under any Hydrail scenario.

4.5.2.11 Stormwater Management and Drainage
As existing stormwater infrastructure would not need to be modified or expanded to accommodate
Hydrail, all scenarios are equally preferred. Electrification is less preferred, as it requires modifications
to the existing stormwater management system.

Environmental Conclusions

4.5.3.1 Overall Assessment
Key Evaluation Criteria
From this assessment, the criteria with the greatest relevance from an environmental evaluation
perspective are:


Footprint impacts (both facility and ROW)



Impacts to built heritage structures



Emissions



Visual and aesthetic impacts

Preferred Scenarios
The full hydrogen-powered train fleet scenarios (3a, 3b, and 3c) are generally preferred, as they:


Eliminate the need for extensive ROW clearing (associated with electrification infrastructure)



Avoid impacts to heritage bridges (required under electrification to provide adequate clearance)



Remove diesel trains from the fleet mix (thereby, reducing emissions, noise, and vibration)



Present the ability to draw power from the grid during periods of low demand (reducing reliance
on fossil fuel generation)



Eliminate the need for extensive aboveground infrastructure with the potential to negatively
impact visual aesthetics in and adjacent to the corridor

Comparison between Preferred Scenarios
Within these alternatives, there are trade-offs to consider that will depend on the ability to mitigate
impacts through design. For example, if the pipeline scenario (3c) could be designed to avoid
impacts to vegetation, archaeological resources, and utilities, the residual environmental impacts
would be minimal. Similarly, if a hydrogen-powered truck fleet was used to deliver fuel to the
dispensing and refuelling facilities, the environmental effects of Scenarios 3a and 3b would be
comparable. Consideration of further information, when available, on the environmental factors
assessed and of additional environmental factors could change the overall preference described.
As electrification requires construction of significant above- and belowground infrastructure,
environmental effects are anticipated to vegetation aquatic and wildlife habitat, contaminated soils,
cultural heritage and archaeology, utilities, air quality, noise and vibration, and visual aesthetics.
While a significant improvement over existing conditions, the ongoing operation of diesel trains
under Scenarios 1, 2a, 2b, and 2c will result in increased emissions when compared to the full
hydrogen-powered train fleet scenarios. And while electrification requires less total electricity, there is
also less flexibility in the timing of grid production, resulting in a potential increase in fossil fuel
reliance.

Based on estimated sizes for PSs, SWSs, TPSs, and
tap sites, the area required for electrification
facilities is 31,104 m2. Additional footprint will be
required for gantries, feeder routes and duct
banks, OCS support structures, OCS maintenance
facilities, bridge replacements and modifications,
and parallel barriers.
Impact to Vegetation and Habitat
Tree removal and vegetation clearing will occur
within 7 m of the outermost electrified track
through construction and operation to provide
safety. Tree removal and vegetation clearing
may be required for infrastructure and facility
construction, and maintenance.
Construction activities may introduce invasive
species. Damage to trees not designated for
removal may occur during construction.
Disturbance to migratory bird nests may occur
during vegetation clearing or bridge
modifications. Temporary displacement of
wildlife or disturbance to SAR may occur during
construction.
Disturbance to Watercourses
There are no direct impacts to watercourses
anticipated as a result of the electrification project.
Potential indirect effects of the construction works
include siltation, introduction of contaminants into
the watercourse using industrial equipment, and
construction debris. Bridge works are
anticipated within Redside dace regulated habitat
at Fourteen Mile Creek, Little Rouge Creek,
Robinson Creek, Brice Creek, and Rouge River.

Five production facilities

would be required. Each
production facility would have
an area of approximately
2,168 m2, and would provide
storage for 3 days’ of fuel.
Total footprint for production,
storage, dispensing, and
refuelling facilities would be
approximately 10,841 m2.
Hydrogen production facilities
would require 32 percent of the
area needed for electrification
facilities.
Impact to Vegetation and
Habitat
Tree and vegetation removal
have the potential to occur
during facility construction.
Construction activities may
introduce invasive species.
Damage to trees not
designated for removal may
occur during construction.
Disturbance to migratory bird
nests may occur during

Disturbance to Watercourses
No effects to watercourses are
anticipated from new facility
footprints.

Facility Footprint
Contaminated soils, groundwater, or both may be
identified during ground disturbance for
infrastructure installation and facility construction.

following exceptions.
Each production facility would
have an area of approximately
2,163 m2, and would provide
storage for 3 days’ of fuel. Total
footprint for production,
storage, dispensing, and
refuelling facilities would be
approximately 15,144 m2.
Hydrogen production facilities
would require 49 percent of
the area needed for
electrification facilities.

Reasoning and Rationale

Same as Scenario 3a,
with the following
exception. Additional
footprint effects would
result from
construction of 488 km
of 4-inch OD steel
pipeline. Effects could
be mitigated by
constructing the
pipeline in the existing
utility corridor or
transportation ROW,
where feasible.

From a natural
environment perspective,
Scenarios 2a and 2b are
preferred, as they result in
the smallest potential
footprint disturbance to
vegetation and wildlife
habitat, and will not require
modifications to existing
water crossings.
Scenarios 3a and 3b are
slightly less preferred, as
the footprint of the
required hydrogen
production facility is
slightly larger than that
required for hybrid dieselhydrogen scenarios.
Pipeline options 2c and 3c
may result in additional
vegetation removals and
watercourse crossings,
making these scenarios less
desirable than the other
Hydrail scenarios.
Electrification is least
preferred for this criterion,
as it requires significant
ROW clearing, footprint
impacts associated with new
facilities, and construction of
new infrastructure in
proximity to watercourses,
including Redside dace
habitat.

Same as Scenario 3b.

From a contaminated soils
perspective, Scenarios 3b
and 3c are preferred, as
they eliminate the operation
of diesel trains and the
requirement to transport
hydrogen using diesel
trucks.
Scenario 2a is least
preferred, as a portion of
the transit fleet remains
diesel, and the central
hydrogen production facility
introduces a requirement for
78 truck trips per day to
transport hydrogen to the
dispensing and fuelling
facilities.

they result in the least

therefore, they minimize
potential impacts to
archaeological resources.

preferred, as pipeline
construction increases
potential to encounter

during periods of low demand (reducing reliance on fossil fuel generation), and eliminate the need for extensive aboveground infrastructure with the potential to negatively impact visual aesthetics in and adjacent to the
corridor. Within these alternatives, there are trade-offs to consider that will depend on the ability to mitigate impacts through design. For example, if the pipeline option could be designed to avoid impacts to vegetation,
archaeological resources, and utilities, the residual environmental impacts would be minimal.
As electrification requires significant physical construction of above- and belowground infrastructure, impacts are anticipated to vegetation and wildlife habitat, cultural heritage and archaeology, utilities, and visual aesthetics.
While a significant improvement over existing conditions, the ongoing operation of diesel trains under electrification will result in increased emissions when compared to the full Hydrail scenarios. And while electrification
requires less total electricity, there is less flexibility in the timing of grid production, resulting in an increased reliance on fossil fuels.

4.5.3.2 Evaluation Limitations
Limited information is available with respect to Hydrail at this early stage of assessment. To fully
account for the anticipated or potential environmental effects of Hydrail, infrastructure design and
impact assessment is required at a similar level of detail as has been completed for electrification. For
these reasons, this should be considered a preliminary high-level review to be used as a guide for
future assessment.

4.5.3.3 Additional Considerations
While the 11 environmental factors assessed in the TPAP EPR were considered in the Hydrail
comparison, additional factors could be considered during a more detailed assessment. Human
health considerations were not assessed due to a lack of available information, but should be
addressed. Climate change and the operational constraints of extreme weather should also be
considered when comparing electrification and Hydrail. Both weather extremes, high electricity
demand during extreme heat, and operations under extreme cold weather should be assessed.
Electricity sources were assumed to be from the current power supply sources, but future electricity
supply may be from more renewable sources. A comprehensive assessment of GHG emissions is
recommended to allow for a comparison of electrification and Hydrail151.
The amount of material to construct electrification and Hydrail infrastructure and the energy to
produce, transport, and dispose of that material could be evaluated in a comprehensive assessment
associated with the electrification and Hydrail scenarios. Large amounts of galvanized steel will be
required for construction of the electrification infrastructure, while different production impacts are
associated with lithium ion batteries. Waste management and recycling for all construction materials,
including lithium ion batteries, would also need to be considered. A review of plans for recycling
programs for automotive and other large-scale lithium ion batteries, and the capacity to support the
high numbers of spent batteries, should be completed.

Laws and Regulations Governing Metrolinx

The Ontario Metrolinx Act (2006) governs the structure of Metrolinx’s business. This act touches on
accountability and the applicability of the Canada Transportation Act. The act applies directly to public
and private railway systems. There is specific federal legislation covering railways that apply to
Metrolinx operations.
There are basic legal requirements under building, electrical, and fire codes on building infrastructure
that apply to Hydrail.
At the legislative level, there is nothing obvious that applies specifically to the use of hydrogen as fuel.
The references start to appear at the regulation level.
Note that there are federal regulations specifically on safety of railways, including:


Railway Safety Act



SOR-2017-121 Locomotive Emissions Regulations



SOR-2015-26 Railway Safety Management Regulations



SOR-2014-258 Railway Operating Certificate Regulations



SOR-87-150 Railway Employee Qualification Standards Regulations

Under the Railway Safety Act (RSA), Metrolinx is responsible for:


The safety of their rail line infrastructure, railway equipment and operations.



Ongoing inspection, testing, and maintenance programs that meet regulatory requirements,



Any specific operating and environmental conditions.

Under the Railway Safety Act (RSA), Transport Canada is responsible for:

Before they could operate their current fleet, Metrolinx had to meet, amongst other requirements, the
Railway Operating Certificate Regulations (SOR/2014-258). To obtain this certificate, the operator
needs to have a safety management system that meets the requirements of the Railway Safety
Management System Regulations (SOR/2015-26). Under the Railway Safety Act, a railway operator
needs to submit a new Risk Assessment before the introduction of a new technology.

4.6.2

Existing Laws, Regulations, Standards, and Codes –
Hydrogen Facilities and Transportation

Hydrogen facility legal requirements, codes, and standards include:
1. CAN/BNQ 1784-000, Canadian Hydrogen Installation Code (2007, currently in review). This code
(commonly referred to as CHIC) is enforced in Ontario (through the Technical Standards and
Safety Authority [TSSA], Fuels division) and is intended to apply to most hydrogen equipment and
systems used for generation, dispensing, storage, and piping. The relevant exceptions are:


Industrial use (process feedstock) or production as by-product



Industrial production of more than 21 kilograms per hour (kg/h)



Liquid hydrogen production



Transportation of hydrogen, including pipelines



Hydrogen onboard vehicles (it is not clear, but inferred, that this includes trains)

For the full-scale deployment of Hydrail, this standard would not apply to the hydrogen
production plant, since the scale (2,000 kg/h) is much higher than the CHIC limit. However, CHIC
would likely apply to a pilot Hydrail project and to various parts of the full-scale project (in fuelling
depots). The CHIC remains as a preferred guide for any hydrogen installation in Canada, since it
has been developed by those experienced in all parts of the hydrogen industry.
2. CSA-B51 Part 1, General Requirements for Boilers, Pressure Vessels and Pressure Piping. This
standard applies to most systems where hydrogen is used or stored at gauge pressure greater
than 101 kiloPascals (kPa). However, it does not apply to cylinders for transportation of hydrogen
regulated by Transport Canada, onboard automotive vehicle hydrogen fuel storage, or refuelling
station pressure piping and ground storage systems.
3. CSA-B51 Part 3, Compressed Natural Gas and Hydrogen Refuelling Station Pressure Piping
Systems and Ground Storage Vessels. This standard covers pressure piping systems with design
pressures greater than 414 kPa (gauge) used in hydrogen refuelling stations and local hydrogen
storage vessels for refuelling stations. This was not intended to apply to trains, though trains are
not specifically excluded and should be relevant, though the size of train systems would be
expected to be much larger than for automobiles or buses.
4. CSA-C22.1, Canadian Electric Code, Part 1. This safety standard provides requirements for
installation of electrical equipment. It does not apply to systems that supply motive power to trains
or are used for railway communications. Of particular note is Section 18 that deals with hazardous
locations where electrical equipment and hydrogen may be present at quantities greater than its
lower flammability limit. A prescribed method for determination of the area classification is not
included in the Canadian Electrical Code, but informative recommendations are provided in
Appendix L. The prescriptive standard from the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC),
IEC-60079-10-1, Explosive Atmospheres - Part 10-1: Classification of Areas - Explosive Gas
Atmospheres, is the main reference used for area classification.

5. ISO 22734-1, Hydrogen generators using water electrolysis process - Part 1: Industrial and
commercial applications. This international standard applies to caustic and solid polymer
electrolyte types, regardless of size. It provides a standard for certification of electrolysis systems
for safety and performance.
6. ISO/TS 19880-1, Gaseous hydrogen — Fueling stations — Part 1: General requirements. This is the
first of a series of international standards (there are parts 1 to 8) specifying requirements and
recommendations for hydrogen fuelling stations for light-duty land vehicles. It particularly notes
that it is suitable guidance for fuelling stations for larger vehicles (buses and trams, though trains
are not noted). The other parts of 19880 cover specialized equipment required in a fuel dispenser
(for example, nozzles). Some discussion of SAE International (SAE) J2601, Fueling Protocols for
Light Duty Gaseous Hydrogen Surface Vehicles, requirements is also presented.
7. ANSI/CSA HGV 4.1, Standard for hydrogen dispensing systems. This North American standard
applies directly to general requirements for integrated automobile hydrogen dispensers. Others
in this series (HGV 4.1-4.8 and 4.10) cover parts of the dispenser system and operation. HGV 4.9
deals with design, installation, and O&M of hydrogen fuelling stations for automobiles. These are
all suitable as some guidance for train hydrogen fuel dispensing systems.
8. CGA G-5.5, Hydrogen Vent Systems: This North American standard is for the safe design of
hydrogen vent systems (required to be pressure systems by CHIC).
9. ISO 14687, Hydrogen fuel quality – Product specification. This international standard specifies the
minimum quality characteristics of hydrogen fuel, including use in fuel cells.
Containers and Transportation of Hydrogen (UN1049 – gas, UN1966 – liquid)
Hydrogen container and transportation requirements, codes, and standards include:
1. SOR 2017-137, Consolidated Transportation of Dangerous Goods Regulations. This act covers
requirements for transportation of hydrogen by road and rail.
2. TP 14877E, Containers for the Transportation of Dangerous Goods by Rail. This Canadian standard
provides the minimum requirements regarding the design, manufacture, qualification, selection,
and use, or testing, of containers for transportation by rail. It applies to compressed gas or liquid
hydrogen.
3. CSA B620-14, Highway tanks and TC transportable tanks for transportation of dangerous goods.
This Canadian standard is used in conjunction with Canadian transportation of dangerous goods
regulations to cover design, fabrication, use, and maintenance of containers transportable by
road. It (along with CSA B621, Selection and use of highway tanks, TC portable tanks, and other
large containers for the transportation of dangerous goods, Classes 3, 4, 5, 6.1, 8, and 9; and B622,
Selection and use of highway tanks, TC portable tanks, and ton containers for the transportation of
dangerous goods, Class 2) applies to compressed gas and liquid hydrogen in all types of
acceptable tanks.
4. CGA G-5, Hydrogen. This well-established North American standard covers hydrogen container
design, and safe storage and handling of containers for compressed gas and liquid.
5. CSA Z662-15, Oil and gas pipeline systems. This Canadian standard extensively covers pipelines
for conveying natural gas, but does not address pipelines specifically for hydrogen.

Hydrogen-powered Locomotion
Hydrogen-powered locomotion legal requirements, codes, and standards include:
1. SAE J2578, Recommended Practice for General Fuel Cell Vehicle Safety. This document relates to
the overall design, construction, and O&M of FCVs. It is intended for automobiles, but relevant for
trains.
2. CSA-B51 Part 2, High-pressure Cylinders for the Onboard Storage of Natural Gas and Hydrogen as
Fuels for Automotive Vehicles. This standard covers only metal, metal-lined, and composite
cylinders between 20 and 1000 litres (L) in capacity used for onboard automotive fuel storage. It
does not appear to apply to trains.
3. IEC 62282-2, Fuel cell technologies - Part 2: Fuel cell modules. This international standard covers
all types of fuel cells of any size, but excludes fuel cells on vehicles. While not stated directly, it
appears to also exclude fuel cells on trains. Part 3 of this standard is for stationary fuel cells, and
Part 4 is for industrial trucks (that is, forklifts).
North American standards have been developed for fuel-cell powered vehicles but are limited to
light-duty vehicles, including automobiles, small trucks, and forklifts. These include:
1. ANSI HGV 3.1, Fuel System Components for Compressed Hydrogen Powered Vehicles
2. ANSI-CSA HPRD 1, Thermally Activated Pressure Relief Devices for Hydrogen Vehicle Fuel
Containers
3. CSA HPIT 1, Compressed Hydrogen Powered Industrial Trucks On-Board Fuel Storage and
Hydrogen Components
4. CSA HPIT 2, Dispensing Hydrogen Powered Industrial Trucks

4.6.3

Other Existing Laws, Regulations, Standards, and Codes
Relevant to Hydrail

There are many existing rail transportation regulations, codes, and standards to cover aspects other
than the driving energy source. To supplement the regulations, codes, and standards presented in
the previous section, there are some additional general codes and standards for hydrogen, including:
1. NFPA-2, Hydrogen Technologies Code. This code applies to American hydrogen installations and
has fewer exceptions than CHIC (particularly for industrial installations), but does exempt onboard
vehicle systems. It is prescriptive, but with disclaimers allowing authority having jurisdiction (AHJ)
discretion. It clearly applies to the fire safety of fixed, transportable, and mobile hydrogen systems.
2. ISO-TR 15916, Basic Considerations for the Safety of Hydrogen Systems. This international
standard provides a comprehensive review of principles for safe design and use of hydrogen in
systems.
3. NFPA-55, Compressed Gases and Cryogenics Fluids Code. This United States (U.S.) code is wellaccepted for guidance on the fire-safety aspects of design and use of compressed gas and liquid
hydrogen systems and containers.
Web-based resources for hydrogen safety are also available. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)
hosts websites with information about OPEX and background safety resources, including:
1. Hydrogen Tools, https://h2tools.org/: Developed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory with
funding from the DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy's Fuel Cell Technologies
Office, the goal of this website is to support implementation of the practices and procedures used

How Existing Regulations Might Need to Change for Hydrail

The Hydrail System can be logically divided up in two ways—either by step in the sequence of
production to use, or by process type. For this discussion, the steps are:
1. Hydrogen Production: This step is assumed to be a single, large-scale, industrial water electrolysis
plant. The electrolysis equipment would be expected to comply with ISO-22734. The plant would
not fall under CHIC, but would follow the normal industrial practice of meeting building codes,
and process vessel and piping codes. As well, hydrogen system engineering expertise would be
fully involved in the project. The design would be proven to be safe to the satisfaction of the AHJ,
often with reference to first principles. No change to codes and standards appears to be needed
in this step.
2. Hydrogen Storage (Production Site): Existing codes and standards (B51 Part 1 and CGA G-5)
adequately cover this.
3. Hydrogen Distribution: Transport Canada regulations and codes adequately cover this, both for
gas and liquid by road and rail. Pipeline distribution is regulated in Ontario by the Ontario Energy
Board, with TSSA responsible for review and inspection according to CSA Group (CSA) codes and
standards (Z662). This is expected to need revision to adequately cover hydrogen, though there
are already approved and operating hydrogen pipelines in Canada (for example, Heartland in
Alberta).
4. Hydrogen Refill (local storage at refuelling site): The existing codes that address refuelling station
storage systems are directed towards public-access automobile refuelling. The rail system
refuelling will differ in several ways. It will be much larger, single-purpose, within a controlled area,
and operated by trained staff. The existing standards (B51 Part 3, ISO/TS 19880) should be able to
be modified for rail. However, B51 Part 1, CGA G-5, and NFPA-2 are also applicable and could be
adequate for this purpose.
5. Hydrogen Dispensing (Refuelling): Requirements for dispensing are not well-defined at this point.
It is expected that the transfer rates will be high compared with those for existing systems based
on automobiles. New equipment and codes (that is, the HGV 4 series) may be needed. For
dispensing liquid hydrogen, existing industrial methods and equipment should be applicable.
6. Hydrogen Vehicle (onboard use of hydrogen): The codes and standards noted in this section
address all the types of systems required for Hydrail locomotives, but only for automobiles and
forklifts. For trains, there is not only a significant change in the size and quantities involved, but the
situation is different because the operation is controlled by trained staff, and the travel is restricted
to dedicated areas. Incorporating allowance for trains into the standards for road vehicles may not
be practical, and new standards may need to be developed. This step in the Hydrail sequence
provides the most complex situation with the most diverse scenarios for safety analysis.

Need for Additional Laws, Regulations, Standards, and
Codes specifically for Hydrail

An overview of the existing regulations, codes, and standards relevant to the use of hydrogen on
passenger trains, as well as the generation, storage, and transportation of hydrogen, has identified
the following for each Hydrail system component:


For hydrogen production, no change to codes and standards appears to be needed.



For hydrogen storage, existing codes and standards are adequate.



For hydrogen distribution, revision to the codes and standards for pipelines may be required.



For hydrogen refill, the existing codes (B51 Part 3, ISO/TS 19880) that address refuelling stations
for automobiles should be modified for rail applications, but the codes (B51 Part 1, CGA G-5, and
NFPA-2) are also applicable and could be adequate for rail.



For hydrogen dispensing, requirements are not well-defined, so new equipment and codes (for
example, the HGV 4 series) may be needed. For dispensing liquid hydrogen, existing industrial
protocols and equipment should be applicable.



For hydrogen vehicles, incorporating allowance for trains into the standards for road vehicles may
not be practical, and new standards may need to be developed.

4.6.6

Proposed Roadmap

To create a comprehensive regulatory framework for Hydrail, the following steps are proposed:
1. Engage a group of hydrogen and rail safety experts to work with Metrolinx.
2. Review Metrolinx’s existing safety management system (for example, programs, procedures,
protocols, training, work activities) to highlight any modification required for Hydrail.
3. Review Transport Canada regulations and standards, CSA codes and standards, U.S. standards,
and ISO standards. Prioritize these codes and standards in terms of applicability to Hydrail.
4. Engage ISO TC197 and CSA working groups to develop new or modify existing codes and
standards specifically for Hydrail.
5. Seek public input and feedback.
6. Preparation and submission of Safety Case for approval by Transport Canada.

Socio-economic Impacts

This section provides an assessment of the socio-economic impacts of Hydrail deployment in Ontario, in
accordance with plans for RER as outlined in the IBC. A quantitative assessment of Hydrail relative to
overhead electrification is outlined, with consideration given to the short- and long-term job creation
and gross domestic product (GDP) impacts. Further to this, a qualitative assessment was conducted,
with consideration given to the additional environmental and economic benefits to be derived by a
decision to pursue Hydrail, including the potential to fully electrify all corridors of the GO network and
to spur the creation of a hydrogen economy in Ontario.

4.7.1

Quantitative Assessment

4.7.1.1 Methodology and Approach
To assess the economic impact of Hydrail relative to overhead electrification, the Statistics Canada
(StatCan) Interprovincial input-output model (the StatCan Model or the I-O model) was used to estimate
the economic impact of each system. A comprehensive economic impact study, including the use of
econometric or Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models, was outside of the scope of this study.
The StatCan model is however considered to be satisfactory for the level of economic impact analysis
required to support the assessment being conducted in this study.
In deriving the inputs into the StatCan model, reliance was placed on the description of the overhead
catenary system (OCS) as described in Section 5.1 and of the Hydrail System as described in Section 4.2,
as well as outputs of the IBC model and the Hydrail Operational Simulation Model, as described in
Section 4.4.
The determination of economic impact is a process of statistical estimations through the various
sources, analysis by subject-matter experts and the use of valid economic and statistical methods. While
the input-output framework provided by StatCan has been validated for accuracy, coherence, and
overall reasonableness, the nature in itself is still an estimation. Further to this, the accuracy of estimates
decreases in situations where the source data is incomplete in detail on a particular commodity, where
there is limited coverage, where concepts are inappropriate concepts and/or where definitions do not
coincide with the input-output accounts.
The method used to determine the economic impact takes a collection of economic multipliers that
translate direct impacts into indirect and induced economic impacts. Direct impacts are the inputs into
the model and are generally defined as a change in industry output or final demand for a good. Indirect
impacts reflect a change in supplier output or final demand to support direct impacts. Induced impacts
reflect additional economic activity as a result of income generated by direct and indirect impacts given,
for example, the increased disposable income of workers.
As an example, in the case of the broadband sector the model would contain data describing supplier
linkages between industries; these linkages generate the indirect economic effect. The industry’s purchases
of repair services, electricity, fuel, and real estate services would generate employment in each of these
sectors. Similarly, the induced economic effect estimated using an I-O model reflects the impact of the
direct activity (broadband) on other sectors through employee purchases. Employees will have additional
disposable income that will be spent at retailers, restaurants, service providers, and other businesses that
will in turn create employment.
For the analysis, the national and provincial economic and tax impacts related to RER and Hydrail will be
estimated using the regional StatCan economic multipliers. The StatCan multipliers are estimated using
an I-O economic model which describes relationships between businesses, households, and
CPG-PGM-RPT-245

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

governments within Canada. This model follows the flow of purchases of local goods by companies, as
well employees, support sales, jobs, and tax revenues across Canada. The StatCan model is used by the
public sector, private-sector businesses and other researchers and is based on widely accepted
methodology for estimating these types of economic linkages.
The multipliers in the StatCan model are based on the Leontief matrix, which estimates the total economic
requirements for every unit of direct output in a given industry using detailed interindustry relationships
documented in the input-output model. The input-output framework connects commodity supply from one
industry to commodity demand by another. The multipliers estimated using this approach capture all of the
upstream economic activity and backward linkages related to an industry’s production, by attaching
technical coefficients to expenditures. These output coefficients (dollars of demand) are then translated
into dollars of GDP, labour income and number of employees, based on industry averages. The analysis will
primarily use the most recent economic multipliers developed by StatCan, currently as at 2013.
The primary benefit of this approach is that the model can be built with a reasonable degree of
accuracy, particularly in view of the limited economic data available for Hydrail. The limitations of this
approach are that:


The analysis assumes constant production functions, labour-capital ratios, and productivity.
Therefore, it is predicting future economic impact on the current economy.



This approach does not allow for differences in the cost of capital to result in capital-labour substitution.



The impact of a tax policy change on an industry cannot be directly predicted. For example,
I-O models contain no information that allows the user to estimate the impact of a 10 percent
investment tax credit on the level of investment. An external estimate of the amount of investment
that would be stimulated by the tax credit would be required as in input to the model.



I-O models do not predict the cross-border flow of capital or population changes.

The I-O Model provides a framework for assessing the order of magnitude of the potential financial and
economic impacts that might arise from alternative assumptions related to the Hydrail and overhead
electrification systems. The impact estimates produced by the I-O Model are subject to a very wide range of
assumptions, all of which can have an important bearing on the results obtained. As such, it is important to
understand that the model is not a forecasting tool but rather a simulation framework for obtaining, in a
structured and organized manner, a sense of the impacts that may arise from the wide range of alternative
assumptions adopted.
The I-O Model incorporates assumptions concerning the building of either system (including, among
other things, location, size and productivity) with a calculation framework for estimating the resulting
financial and economic impacts. In setting the initial estimates for the model parameters, we have made
use of data gathered from several sources, including past economic impact studies and StatCan inputoutput models, as well as real estate, construction and transit industry experts.
To generate estimates of the financial and economic impacts, the Economic Impact Model incorporates
numerous assumptions regarding the two systems. These key inputs include:


Location of CAPEX



The jurisdiction wherein the equipment is built



The value of construction costs and operating costs

4.7.1.2 Limitations due to Data Inputs
The assumptions that are associated with the inputs and the impacts that these assumptions could
have on the outputs are detailed below (Table 4-43). Where there was uncertainty or lack of detail
certain assumptions had to be made about the inputs. These assumptions are also detailed.
TABLE 4-43 LIMITATIONS DUE TO DATA INPUTS
Input
Costs

Description, Assumptions, Limitations
All costs include design, labour, contractors and materials.
Assumptions: Each cost item was assumed to have a mix between these four components to estimate the
impact in different industries.
Limitations: The ultimate results will be impacted slightly as each industry, product and service has
different economic impacts.

Labour Costs

All inputs related to labour costs represent total compensation costs, which typically include related items
such as vacation pay, medical and dental benefits, life insurance, and employment assistance programs.
Assumptions: Benefits, termed SLI in the I-O model, are based on the StatCan model for each service
type, and varies industry to industry. SLI includes EI, and health and life insurance.
Limitations: The assumptions across all labour costs may result in different direct labour impacts and
direct employment, as the rate of benefits can differ between unionized workers and non-unionize
workers, part-time, full-time and temporary workers, thereby causing a potential difference in the output
values.

Material
Costs

Material Costs are described by their underlying commodity.
Assumptions: Based on general knowledge of the underlying items, major categories of commodities
were used.
Limitation: The ultimate results will be impacted by the commodity applied as each commodity has
different economic impacts.

Location of
suppliers

At this stage, the business case does not specify the suppliers of the material and services, therefore it is
not possible to definitively determine whether the material and service providers are located in Ontario,
Canada or internationally.
Assumptions: The StatCan model dictates, based on its historical data whether the underlying commodity
is wholly or partially produced in Canada or internationally
Limitations: The location of the material is a significant assumption. Given that design specifications have
yet to be determined for either technology, it is difficult to determine where materials will be purchased.
For both technologies, there are limited categories and historical information in Canada to realistically
indicate the mix of supplier locations. The actual supply mix will impact the result, with a negative impact
being more international purchases. The output will provide the direct impact on Ontario. We have
considered the inputs from all of Canada.

Industry
categories

Industry categories are based on operating or capital activities rather than the industry categories used
by Statistics Canada.
Assumptions: Each cost, based on the knowledge provided and with the assistance of StatCan, was
placed into a specific SUPC required by the StatCan model.
Limitations: There may be variances between the SUPC chosen and the actual SUPC of the underlying
commodity or service. Assumptions may have been made for the proper categories of OPEX and CAPEX
for both systems to fit within the framework of the StatCan model. This was necessary for Hydrail because,
while there is an existing hydrogen industry, the industry in Canada is relatively small. As such, StatCan
does not necessarily have individual classifications for the relevant capital components or related
services.

Financial Costs and Assumptions for Hydrail
The Hydrail System is assumed to maintain the same level of service and delivery as proposed for RER.
To isolate the true differences between Hydrail and overhead electrification, only the cost items that
are directly and explicitly impacted by Hydrail are altered from the IBC model to the Hydrail
simulation model. The three line items impacted are described in Table 4-45.

In the RER model, this refers to the maintenance and renewal of the overhead

In the Hydrail model, these overhead lines do not exist. The costs therefore are
associated with maintenance of the hydrogen infrastructure, and is estimated at
10 percent of the capital costs.
Since there is a portion of the infrastructure that is similar to overhead electrification,
such as guideways and signaling, there are assumptions built in to the breakdown
of the costs for the I-O Model that these costs would remain the same.

4.7.1.4 Economic Impacts
RER will generate a wide range of financial and economic impacts on the province, including:


Incremental growth in the Province’s GDP arising from the construction and the ongoing
operation of either an overhead electrification or Hydrail Syste



The creation of new employment during the construction and ongoing operation of either system

Gross Domestic Product
The analysis considered the direct and indirect tax revenue that each level of government may
potentially receive as a result of Overhead Electrification and Hydrail in Ontario (Table 4-46). The
results indicate that RER implementation will positively impact GDP, with Hydrail being expected to
generate approximately $2.6B more in GDP than overhead electrification.

Equivalent (FTE) jobs, while implementation through Hydrail can be expected to lead to the creation
of 427,734 FTE jobs (Table 4-47). FTE is the ratio of the average number of paid hours during a period
(part time and full time) by the total number of working hours in that period. In other words, one FTE is
equivalent to one employee working full-time. The FTE job metric is measured in person-years, as in
the number of FTE per the hours required on an annual basis to qualify as such.

The FTE job numbers are likely overstated since I-O is a static model and does not incorporate
dynamic macro variables such as, labour force, population, wages, and salary growth over time. Using
2014 dollars, it is likely that over the life of the project, wages and salaries, labour supply constraints,
and more generally, business cycles, would impact the number of FTE per the proposed OPEX and
CAPEX, and likely overstate the number of FTE jobs.

4.7.2

Qualitative Assessment

A consideration of the qualitative, non-financial and/or social aspects of the Hydrail is necessary to
fully understand the impact of Hydrail relative to overhead electrification. The government is
accountable to the community and its use of public funds. Therefore, all benefits and costs must be
considered (where possible and as practical) to ensure the best option for the community is
progressed, even if the option is not optimal in financial terms.
A role of government is deliver public goods and services such as community transit. These projects,
by addressing public issues, result in many qualitative, but significant impacts. These must be
identified, considered and assessed for an informed government decision to occur.
Social impacts refer to the effects of an activity on the well-being of communities and people. Due to
this broad definition, for the purposes of this study we have sought to only identify and discuss those
qualitative and/or social impacts that are unique to the use of Hydrail, as opposed to electrification of
the system in general, or other methods of powering rail.
We have broadly identified three core areas of qualitative impacts that are important to consider
alongside the financial results when determining the long-term feasibility of Hydrail:


Industry impacts



Environmental impacts



Community impacts

Each of the above identified areas are discussed in the sections that follow. The discussion focusses
on the nature of the impact (that is, positive or negative) rather than the extent of such impact.

4.7.2.1 Industry Impacts
Fuelling Innovation and the Hydrogen Economy
While the hydrogen and fuel cell sectors in Canada is growing in Canada, it still represents a very
small percentage of the country’s GDP. An investment in Hydrail will lead to growth in not only this
sector, but also other sectors that support the Hydrail System, such as the automotive, oil and gas and
power and utilities sectors.
Though the broader economic impacts of this investment have been considered, it is also important
to note the qualitative or social benefit of growth of the hydrogen and fuel cell sectors. It is expected
that a decision to use Hydrail for RER would act as a catalyst and drive interest and activity in the
sector, due to the arising need for supporting infrastructure. Further to this, Hydrail can facilitate the
establishment of infrastructure to also facilitate the deployment of hydrogen and fuel cell technology
in other areas of transportation. This would incentivize an increase in research and development
(R&D), drive innovation and technology improvements. These activities will create the right economic
conditions or climate to stimulate demand for further investment in this industry and technology.

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

Skilled Workers
Our economic impact analysis indicates that, relative to overhead electrification, Hydrail will create
over 40,000 more jobs across a range of industries. While a clear economic benefit, it is important to
note the qualitative benefits associated with this growth. This investment in technology that is
relatively new to the province would support and drive the up-skilling of labour, resulting in more
Ontarians becoming skilled technicians available to construct, deploy, maintain and repair a Hydrail
System. It is however noted that a significant and immediate investment will have to made to train the
required workforce, such that skilled labour is available as required for Hydrail deployment, and to
limit the need to import labourers.

4.7.2.2 Environmental Impacts
Full Electrification of the GO Network
As noted in Section 4.2.1.2, the current plans for electrification of the GO network do not include the
Richmond Hill and Milton lines nor do they include the extremities of the Kitchener and Lakeshore
West lines. These rail lines or sections were not included because of concerns of flooding along the
Richmond Hill line and complexities surrounding obtaining approval for installation of an OCS along
rail lines or sections that are not owned by Metrolinx.
Hydrail, however, eliminates or reduces these concerns, thereby allowing for the full electrification of
the GO network. The environmental impact of this is significant, as there would be a further reduction
in GHG emissions with the full phasing out of diesel fuelled rail vehicles. All other benefits of
electrification relative to diesel will also extend to these rail lines or sections, thereby increasing the
overall benefit of the RER program.
Supporting renewable energy
Hydrogen has the potential to support the generation and supply of renewable energy. Hydrogen can
act as an energy storage medium, thereby allowing for renewable energy, such as solar and wind
energy, to be captured when available and stored. Stored energy can then be used to generate
electricity at times when market would otherwise demand exceeds supply.
The increase in research and development activity generated from the deployment of Hydrail in
Ontario, will likely lead to increased knowledge and innovation in respect of the use of hydrogen as
an energy storage medium. This could lead to wider benefits accruing to the benefit because of
increased access to clean energy. The province could also benefit from reduced cost of delivering
electricity to Ontarians, as energy storage options allow for increased ability to the maximize the use
of existing renewable energy generating facilities, thereby deferring investments in new infrastructure.
Noise
The construction of an overhead catenary system that extends across the GO network will generate
noise and vibration during the construction phase, which are likely to disrupt local residents. The level
of disruption is expected to be less with Hydrail, noting that there would be relatively minimal
construction activity associated with the development of hydrogen infrastructure.

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

4.7.2.3 Community Impacts
Availability and Reliability
During the construction phase, disruptions to transportation caused by the construction of an OCS
may have long term consequences, particularly given longer commute times, with higher than usual
congestions on roads, highways, and subways as commuters seek alternative transportation options.
These factors would ultimately negatively impact economic productivity.
During the operations phase, no differences are expected between overhead electrification and
Hydrail in terms of availability and commuter waiting times. As discussed in Section 4.2.1.2, each
locomotive will be prepared for service in an identical manner, with no difference with regards to the
dispatching timeline. In the initial roll-out of the project however, delays may occur as employees or
technicians would take some time to advance along the learning curve. As such, maintenance or
servicing of a HFC-powered rail vehicle will likely require greater time than for vehicles powered by an
OCS. This time off the track for maintenance or servicing may disrupt schedules and thus cause
commuter delays, which would translate into reduced productivity.
Initiative to Transition Ontario to a Hydrogen Economy
The introduction of Hydrail on the GO network can serve as a launching pad for the establishment of a
hydrogen economy in Ontario, as described in Section 4.9.1. This could in turn have far reaching
socio-economic benefits across the province.
As has been noted in the preceding sections of this study, hydrogen has a variety of different uses in
industry, with significant annual production levels globally. Within the transportation sector, hydrogen
can be used to fuel vehicles and, where derived from clean sources, allows for a significant reduction
in the level of GHG emissions historically generated from transportation. As part of a global
imperative to reduce GHG emissions, several governments, including the Ontario government, have
allocated funding to facilitate the transition to hydrogen and other clean energy sources for
transportation.
Ontario’s expertise in the development of HFCs and the generation of clean energy, can be leveraged
to support the transition to clean fuel sources in Ontario and beyond, and also support the local
production of hydrogen for other industrial purposes. A significant barrier has been the necessary
investment in infrastructure to support the adoption of hydrogen fueled vehicles.
The scale of operations needed to fully support the GO network, can serve to attract initial
investments to develop, and later expand hydrogen generation, storage, distribution and fuelling
facilities, along with HFC production facilities within the province. These investments can lead to the
broader application of hydrogen as a fuel in other areas of transportation, including other forms of
public transportation such as buses, streetcars and subways services; municipal fleets such as school
buses and garbage trucks; commercial fleets; and private motor vehicles. Such wide scale application
can in turn lead to an increasing demand for skilled labour along each step of the supply chain, and
the potential for increased production of the various components within the province. This will spur
other indirect and induced impacts throughout the economy.
Ontario is already recognized as a global leader in the development of HFC technology and in the
generation of clean energy. The development and accumulation of skills and knowledge to support
the hydrogen supply chain within Ontario will eventually also position the province as a thought
leader in hydrogen technologies. Ontario will be able to export its expertise to other regions looking
to transition to clean fuels for transportation, thereby increasing the economic benefits associated
with Hydrail.

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

Given the global drive to reduce GHG emissions, the opportunities for the application of hydrogen as
a fuel source for transportation are significant. To date, there has however been low penetration of
hydrogen in transportation globally. Ontario’s early adoption and development of relevant skills and
knowledge therefore presents significant opportunities to propel the local economy, and to facilitate
the global transition to clean energy.

4.7.3

Conclusion

The quantitative analysis presented indicates that Hydrail is expected to have a slightly greater
economic impact than overhead electrification, in respect of the ability to spur job creation and GDP
growth. The benefits of Hydrail are enhanced when considering other benefits as described in the
qualitative analysis. In particular, the potential for the development of a hydrogen economy in Ontario
has not been quantified, but as discussed, the resulting impacts would be significant. Further to this,
there are other key societal benefits to be derived from the ability to electrify the full GO network, and
the enhanced ability to support renewable electricity generation and clean fuels across all modes of
transportation. These additional benefits suggest that the province will realize greater socio-economic
benefits using HFC to power trains on the GO network.

Public Acceptance

While Canada is a global leader in the development of HFC technology, there has been little
application of the technology in transportation in Canada. As discussed in Section 4.10, most
applications in public transportation fleets or in passenger vehicles have occurred in British Columbia.
Ontario has seen application of the technology on a much smaller scale, but only in powering forklifts.
Accordingly, there is limited experience with hydrogen as source of fuel among average citizens, who
best know hydrogen for its combustive properties.
Hydrail deployment in Ontario will involve the creation of hydrogen generation and storage facilities
within the province, possibly in proximity to residential and commercial centres, and the operation of
passenger trains with reservoirs of hydrogen onboard. Given the likely perception of hydrogen as a
highly combustible gas, should a Hydrail deployment be pursued, a robust public education
campaign would have to be designed and implemented. The campaign should facilitate a high
degree of comfort around the safety of hydrogen for use in transportation in general, and in
passenger rail operations in particular.
The most wide-scale implementation of hydrogen and HFC technology in transportation in North
America has come with the development of the California Hydrogen Highway Network (CaH2Net or
the Hydrogen Highway). There are limited cases of the use of HFC technology in passenger rail across
the globe, with the most relevant and advanced case being the planned German deployment of
HFC-powered trains into full service, across five states, in 2018.
This section provides an overview of the public engagement strategies employed in California and
Germany, and recommends steps to be taken to facilitate public acceptance of a deployment in
Ontario.

4.8.1

The California Hydrogen Highway154

In April 2004, the Governor of California signed Executive Order S-7-04, calling for the creation of the
Hydrogen Highway in response to the need to diversify the state’s sources of transportation energy,
while also providing environmental and economic benefits.
The Executive Order (EO) called for:


The designation of California’s 21 interstate freeways as the CaH2Net



The planning and build-up of a network of hydrogen fuelling stations along these roadways and in
the urban centres they connect so that by 2010, every Californian will have access to hydrogen
fuel



The acceleration of progress in hydrogen use through public incentives and financing
mechanisms



The promotion of economic development opportunities resulting from increased use of hydrogen
for stationary and mobile applications

The development was being pursued over three phases, as demonstrated in Table 4-48.

Phase 1 was to be implemented over a 2-year period, and Phase 3 was expected to be complete
by 2010.
An EO Team was formed to manage the development of a California Hydrogen Blueprint Plan (the
Blueprint). The Blueprint, which initially focussed on Phase 1 of the implementation, was developed
through a process of partnership and cooperation with stakeholders.
The EO Team was counselled by a Senior Review Committee, consisting of senior state government
officials, and an Implementation Advisory Panel, which consisted of high-level representatives from
industry, California State agencies, federal and local government agencies, academia, and public
advocacy groups. In addition to this, volunteer experts across an array of government agencies,
private industry, academia, and environmental organizations provided detailed technical, financial,
and policy inputs across five topic teams, namely:
1. Rollout Strategy
2. Societal Benefits
3. Economy
4. Implementation
5. Public Education
The Blueprint presented a series of findings and recommendations for the development of the
Hydrogen Highway.
Today, there are approximately 29 open-retail and 4 on-retail hydrogen fuelling stations in operation
in California, with 37 more stations scheduled to be opened by the end of 2017. As of April 2017,
there were over 1,600 active registrations of FCEVs155. The sections that follow describe the public
education strategy recommended by the Marketing, Communications, and Public Education Topic
Team (Topic Team) as part of the development of the Blueprint.

4.8.1.1 Marketing, Communications, and Public Education Topic Team
Report156
In its report to the EO Team, the Topic Team emphasized that public education would be a key factor
to the success of the Hydrogen Highway, noting the importance of the public understanding the
reasons for the initiative and being supportive of it. The Topic Team asserted that key groups would
have to be engaged, and active public education, marketing, and communications campaigns would
be essential. Early engagement was also considered important, to avoid misinformation causing
negative views to take hold.
While it was recommended that one key message be communicated across all stakeholder groups, it
was also deemed necessary to identify key messages and action steps for each group. The key groups
identified and messages suggested are summarized in this section.
Key Groups

Technology and Industry Enablers
Companies, industry associations, labour organizations, and research institutions will need to facilitate
technology advancements and commercial installations. They will need to recognize the business
opportunities that a hydrogen economy presents, and help to communicate to the wider public on its
merits.

Government, Policymakers, and Policy Influencers
The advancement of hydrogen technology and the installation of hydrogen infrastructure will require
the support of this group to create the necessary policies and regulatory environment. This group will
have to be educated on hydrogen and hydrogen technology, particularly in regards to the safety of
hydrogen’s production, delivery, and use, as well as the potential benefits of a hydrogen economy.

Consumers, Customers, and News Media
The general public should be educated such that they understand that using hydrogen in
transportation is consistent with other sustainability policies. The public education campaign should
allow for the public to become familiar and comfortable with hydrogen, understanding that is it as
safe as other fuels, and that HFC-powered vehicles have the potential to deliver performance and
utility similar to other vehicles.
For communities where hydrogen fuelling stations will be installed, there should be early and
concentrated efforts at the local level. This will engender a sense of pride in having hydrogen
programs in these communities, before fear and opposition, based on a lack of knowledge, sets in.

Education Community
It was recommended that a sustained program, covering basic concepts related to hydrogen and fuel
cells, be incorporated into curriculum guidelines throughout all levels of California’s education
system. Community colleges were also recognized as playing an integral role in the development of a
workforce to support the hydrogen economy, so it was recommended that they incorporate hydrogen
and sustainable technology in their programs. It was also suggested that universities, colleges, and

research institutions expand their roles in the training of engineers, scientists, business leaders, and
policymakers to support the hydrogen economy.
Key Messages
It was recommended that the communication strategy be centralized, directed, and coordinated at a
senior policy-making level to support success. Additionally, for each key group identified, a single,
visible, and accessible point of contact should also be identified.
To the greatest extent possible, joint participation between industry, government, nongovernment
organizations (NGOs), and academia was encouraged, as this would demonstrate the depth of
support for the hydrogen economy. It was, however, noted that care should be taken in developing
communications and public engagement programs, so that unrealistic expectations are not created
that would threaten public and political support.

4.8.2

The German Experience

The German Federal Government had set 2030 objectives to reduce CO2 emissions by 55 percent
and generate 50 percent of electricity from renewable sources. In view of this, there was strong
industry and public interest in reducing emissions along rail routes.
Roughly 50 percent of the German rail network is not electrified; however, overhead catenary
construction was considered to be too capital intensive, negatively impacting profitability on some
sections of the network. Further to this, overhead catenary lines were not desirable in scenic areas,
where the necessary infrastructure would detract from the landscape. Electric trains, powered by HFC
technology, were seen as an interesting and promising option to reduce emissions, develop a
hydrogen industry, and meet stakeholder expectations.
Germany has a long history with hydrogen in transportation. The German government has identified
hydrogen and fuel cell technology as essential to the future of mobility and energy supply. In 2002,
the Clean Energy Partnership (CEP) was established, as a joint venture (JV) between government and
industry, to test the suitability of hydrogen as a fuel157. In 2006, the government, industry, and science
established the 10-year National Innovation Programme for Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology (NIP)
to facilitate the development of these technologies and provide support for initial products.
Fuel cell hybrid buses have been in operation in Hamburg, Germany since 2011 and in Stuttgart,
Germany since 2013. The government has also formed partnerships with car manufacturers since
2003. In 2007, the first set of hydrogen-powered vehicles were handed over to customers. Today,
there are over 400 cars in operation in Germany. The German government has pledged continued
support of innovations in HFC technology for use in various transportation sectors, including buses,
transportation, and rail.
The first hydrogen filling station went into operation in Berlin in 2004, and there is currently a network
of 32 hydrogen fuelling stations in operation in Germany. These stations were sponsored by the
German government through the NIP. Germany plans to have 100 filling stations in operation by 2018
and as many as 400 by 2025, supported by an investment of €350 million by the German
government158.
Since 2008, the CEP has been engaged in intensive public relations activities, aimed at effectively
anchoring hydrogen in the public consciousness as a fuel and energy store. A long-term

communication plan was developed for defined target groups, with various tools used to engage
each group, including print and web-based communication, appearances at trade fairs, viral films,
social media activities, Campus Days at select universities, and test drive events.

4.8.2.1 Government’s Role in Using Hydrogen in Transportation
The National Organisation Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology (NOW) was founded in February 2008
as a federally owned company. It was established to:


Administer the programs for NIP and electro-mobility on behalf of the Federal Ministry of
Transport



Act as an interface for the strategic alliance of government, the scientific community, and industry



Allocate public funding and to create synergies in the industry



Act as a competency and public education centre

NOW’s management is supported by a Supervisory Board and an Advisory Board. The Advisory
Board has the task of providing both content and technical consultation support to the management
of the program partners for NIP implementation. The board comprises representatives from
18 interest groups, across government, science, industry, and infrastructure.
The NIP was specifically created to facilitate product and process innovations. It also facilitates
partnerships across government, industry, and academia. The NIP was initially funded by the Federal
Ministry of Economics and Technology (14 percent), the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital
Infrastructure (36 percent), and industry partners (50 percent). The Federal Ministry of Transport and
Digital Infrastructure has also contributed up to €500 million for industry-led research projects.
FIGURE 4-46 NATIONAL ORGANISATION HYDROGEN AND FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY OVERVIEW

The Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure intends to invest approximately
€250 million in Phase 2 of the NIP by 2019159. Under Phase 2, the ministry is promoting the
competitiveness of technically mature products.

4.8.2.2 NOW’s Role in Hydrail Development in Germany
In 2014, the Federal Ministry for Transport and Digital Infrastructure, through the NIP, committed
€7.9 million in support of the development of HFC-powered rail vehicles, with the first prototypes
expected to go into test service operation by the end of 2016. The government’s support was based
on the view that electricity-based fuels from renewable energy were key for sustainable mobility, and
also allowed for new job creation in Germany.
The vehicles were to be developed and manufactured by train manufacturer, Alstom, in the
company’s competence centre for regional trains in Salzgitter, Germany. The German states of Lower
Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Baden-Württemberg, and Hesse had signed Letters of Intent for the
purchase of HFC-powered train sets.
NOW also commissioned a study to assess the feasibility of the use of HFC to propel trains in Germany.
The research examined the technical, legal, and economic requirements for hydrogen integration into
existing rail infrastructure. The study showed that deploying HFC trains is economically feasible in
principle. A public engagement roadmap was produced as a part of the study.
Even though by 2016 there was already a high level of public acceptance of hydrogen-fuelled
transportation in Germany, a government-led public relations, education, and stakeholder
consultation campaign for Hydrail was key. As a part of the public engagement plan, a Fuel Cell
Electro-mobility in Rail Transportation symposium was jointly held by NOW, Alstom, and Lower
Saxony’s Ministry for Economy, Labour and Transport in 2016.
The symposium was intended to lay the foundation and bring greater focus on the topic of Hydrail
among key players from government and industry. The event focussed on technical issues on both the
vehicle and infrastructure sides, and considered national and European transportation strategy
policies and perspectives of various transportation service providers. A second symposium was held
in 2017, where a model HFC train was made available for test rides.

4.8.2.3 Regional Governments’ Roles in Hydrail Development in Germany
German regional governments control the public transit authorities; accordingly, their commitment to
purchase HFC-powered trains through signing Letters of Intent was a significant driving force behind
the development of the technology for trains. Aside from the environmental benefits, the regional
governments recognized the potential for job creation and economic development. As at
March 2017, Alstom had signed Letters of Intent to purchase a total of 60 trains from the German
states of Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Baden-Württemberg, and the Hessian transport
association Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund160.
Political leadership was also instrumental in public acceptance of the technology. They provided
support by being at the forefront of public engagement and consultation.

4.8.3

Differences between Ontario and the California and German
Deployments

In California, there had been some familiarity with the use of hydrogen as a fuel when the Blueprint
was initiated. At the time, there was an estimated 39 stations either planned or in existence in the
state, and 200-300 light-duty FCVs were already being provided as part of existing industry and
government programs. Further to this, the scale of hydrogen production needed to support the

planned vehicle deployment across the state was small in comparison to the scale required to support
RER, as planned in Ontario. Another significant difference lies in the timeline to full deployment. The
CaH2Net has now been in active development over a 12-year period, and while there have been
successes, the level of deployment of hydrogen-fuelled vehicles has not reached 20,000, which is the
goal set in the Blueprint for realizing full-scale commercialization of hydrogen and fuel cell
technologies.
In Germany, public engagement was consistent and strategic over roughly 6 years prior to the
decision to pursue the use of HFC to power passenger trains. Familiarity with hydrogen and HFC
technology had advanced to the point where it was easier for the public to assess the advantages and
risks of Hydrail relative to overhead electrification.
In the Ontario context, public engagement will have to play an even more significant role in a Hydrail
implementation plan, particularly given that the starting point in respect to public awareness and
acceptance of the technology is vastly different. This is especially important within the context of very
vocal communities that are significantly empowered at the municipal level. Provincial mandates are
often actively challenged, and the strong opposition of activists within communities can force plans to
be abandoned, where the province is unable to engender the support of community members.

4.8.4

Recommendations for Ontario Deployment

Should Hydrail be pursued in Ontario, it will be important to identify all stakeholders across federal
and local government bodies, communities, political representation, industry, academia, labour
groups, environmental groups, media, and any other key groups.
A clear communication plan should be developed and promptly implemented. The plan should
outline the reasons for pursuing Hydrail, take a balanced approach to outlining the rationale within
the context of competing technologies, and directly address the risks and challenges presented by
Hydrail deployment. It is recommended that there be consultation and dialogue with key
stakeholders, using surveys, community meetings, symposia, and demonstrations. These methods
have been identified as key success factors in California and in Germany.

4.8.4.1 Key Themes
Similar to the German example, the key themes of the approach should address the five phases of
hydrogen use for rail:


Production



Transport



Storage



Fuelling



Usage

The key themes at each of the phases are further broken into five subject areas:


Safety



Sustainability



Environmental



Economics



Reliability, as described in this section

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

Safety
The safety of the technology, systems, and processes is likely to be of significant concern to the
public. Controls across the five phases, as well as mechanisms to prevent leakages and to minimize
the impact of systems failures or human error, should be strongly emphasized. Where possible,
opportunities should be provided for the public to experience the technology, a key example being
the demonstrations and test rides that were offered to members of the public in Germany.
Given that safety concerns will largely centre on the supply and storage of hydrogen, the public
should be educated on the long history of the generation and use of hydrogen in various processes
across industry. Existing safety standards and the industry’s track record in meeting the standards set
should also be highlighted.
Sustainability
With the increased focus on sustainability in transportation, the public will likely be interested in the
sustainability of Hydrail, relative to both diesel and overhead electrification. This should not only
consider the ultimate source of hydrogen, but also the sustainability of the hydrogen supply chain. As
discussed in Section 4.3, Ontario’s electricity system should accommodate the supply of relatively
clean electricity to produce hydrogen through electrolysis. Further consideration should, however, be
given to the carbon footprint of other processes, such as the supply of water and the transportation of
hydrogen. The additional benefit of being able to electrify the full GO network (including the Milton
and Richmond Hill lines) should be considered, and the sustainability of the full Hydrail system
assessed in comparison to traditional diesel and electrification, using a well-to-wheel approach.
Environmental
The installation of overhead catenaries across the GO network will require the removal of
approximately 2.5 km2 (square kilometres) of trees; therefore, will have a significant negative
environmental impact, in addition to the visual impact of wires strung across the province’s landscape.
While Hydrail will not have a similar impact, concerns will likely be raised about the environmental
impact of potential leakages or spills, particularly at hydrogen storage sites or during transportation.
Environmental stakeholders and regulators will have to be engaged, and a level of comfort provided
around mechanisms that will be in place to prevent spills or leakages, or to limit the environmental
impact where spills or leakages cannot be prevented. The ability to comply with existing standards
will have to be demonstrated, and the need for additional standards emerging from the establishment
of Hydrail and related services will have to be assessed.
Economics
Given the size of the RER project, the public is likely to have strong concerns about the economic
benefit of any plan to electrify the network. These concerns will likely be magnified in considering the
use of HFC technology, given that the technology has had limited application in passenger rail, with
no instances of application on the scale being considered in Ontario. A decision to pursue Hydrail will,
therefore, have to be supported by robust financial and economic assessments that demonstrate the
merit of RER in general, and the use of HFC technology as opposed to traditional electrification.
The economic benefits should also be assessed within the context of the broader socio-economic
benefits of Hydrail. Hydrail creates the strong potential for increased economic activity within the
province to support the five phases of hydrogen use, as well as the production of HFCs. These
benefits should be highlighted, with a clear demonstration of provincial, commercial, and institutional
plans to support the training and development of workforces to support the full supply chain.

Reliability
Particularly within the context of the cost of a Hydrail implementation and the cost of failure, public
engagement will have to facilitate a high degree of comfort around the reliability of HFC technology
and the hydrogen supply chain.
While there is a long history of electrification in public transit for buses, streetcars, and subway trains,
HFC has had relatively limited application in public transportation. This will generate concerns around
the long-term prospects for the technology. The public should also be aware of Canada’s role in the
development of the technology, and government and industry sponsored initiatives to improve the
technology, as discussed in Section 4.9. This will allow for comfort around the level of commitment
from government and industry to the continued development of HFC technology.
There are limitations in respect to current hydrogen fuelling technology that should also be
adequately addressed, with a clear demonstration of the ability to overcome challenges. Further to
this, concerns will arise around the hydrogen supply chain, given the limited examples of large-scale
production and storage of hydrogen. There should be a clear demonstration of the scalability of
hydrogen technology along each step of the supply chain and the market’s capacity to support
Hydrail in Ontario.

Implementation Readiness

This section provides an assessment of technological readiness at present, describes expected
changes to the maturity of the technology, and considers competing technologies. This assessment
forms the basis for the rest of the report.
The section also provides an overall assessment of the readiness of the industry to support Hydrail
deployment in Ontario, including hydrogen generation, storage, transportation, and fuelling, as well
as fuel cell technologies. This section also discusses deficiencies and what may be required to ready
the industry should there be gaps.

4.9.1

Hydrogen Economy161

Hydrogen can, in principle, replace all forms of energy in use today and serve all sectors of the
economy. The fundamental attraction of hydrogen over fossil fuels is its potential environmental
advantages. At the point of use, hydrogen can be burned, or it can be converted to electricity in a fuel
cell, producing no harmful emissions. If hydrogen is produced without emitting any GHGs, it could
form the basis of a truly sustainable energy system – the hydrogen economy.
In a world that has transitioned to the hydrogen economy, an efficient and competitive hydrogen
production, storage, and transportation system has been built; and hydrogen has become widely
accepted as a clean, safe, and sustainable form of energy. A hydrogen economy could be as follows:


Hydrogen is produced through electrolysis using electricity derived solely from nuclear power or
renewable energy sources, or through thermochemical or biological techniques based on
renewable biomass. Produced hydrogen is burned in highly efficient gas turbines to provide
electricity, or is piped to customers. Hydrogen is also used to store the intermittent energy
generated from wind turbines and photovoltaics.



Highly efficient hydrogen-powered vehicles are used to convey people and goods. Most of these
vehicles refuel at public stations fed by centralized hydrogen production facilities. Small-scale
natural gas reformers or renewable-energy-powered electrolysis plants are also used at home or
in the workplace to produce the hydrogen required for filling on-board hydrogen tanks.



Home owners have the choice of buying electricity from the grid or supplying their own energy
needs using hydrogen with a dedicated fuel cell that provides electricity and thermal energy for
heating and cooling.

Like any other product, hydrogen must be stored, transported, and transferred to bring it from
production to final use (Figure 4-47). While production and final use has been the focus of attention
for many years, the infrastructure required to store, transport, and transfer the hydrogen for final use
in a hydrogen economy is not fully developed or is nonexistent in many jurisdictions, including
Ontario.

Various governments around the world have developed policies and provided funding to kick-start
development of the required infrastructure for the hydrogen economy. This section provides a
summary of the required infrastructure in other jurisdictions.

4.9.1.1 California Hydrogen Highway Network162
The CaH2Net was initiated in April of 2004 to support and catalyze a rapid transition to a clean,
hydrogen transportation economy in California. The goal was to assure that hydrogen fuelling stations
were in place to meet the demand of fuel cell and other hydrogen vehicle technologies being placed
on California’s roads.
The CaH2Net was the first point of coordination between the California government, academia, and
private industry stakeholders, establishing a shared vision in the form of a Blueprint describing the
actions needed to create a hydrogen highway. The 2004 Blueprint identified four main principles that
would contribute to the achievement of CaH2Net:
1. The CaH2Net should be developed in phases.
2. The State should co-fund the early phases of station deployment.
3. Hydrogen produced as a transportation fuel should be in line with the State’s environmental goals.
4. The State should establish policies that help create a favourable business climate for establishing
hydrogen infrastructure.
The Government of California has introduced following policies and funding programs to support
hydrogen transportation initiatives:


Staff from the California Air Resources Board, California Energy Commission, and the Governor’s
Office of Business and Economic Development, along with other state agencies, closely
coordinate and work with other government and industry stakeholders to implement actions that
support the development of a robust hydrogen and FCEV market.



Assembly Bill 8 (AB 8) provides a specific focus on development of the state’s hydrogen fuelling
station network. AB 8 dedicates up to $20 million per year to support continued construction of at
least 100 hydrogen fuel stations.



Executive Order B-16-201211 provides another strong policy driver for accelerating
commercializing FCEVs and their associated hydrogen fuel station network.



The State of California is co-funding the initial network of hydrogen fuelling stations, in advance of
vehicle launches, through the Energy Commission’s Alternative and Renewable Fuel and Vehicle
Technology Program.

As of April 5, 2017, more than 1,600 FCEVs had active registrations with the California Department of
Motor Vehicles. Drivers of these early market cars can fuel at 29 Open-Retail stations, nine of which
are new fully retail fuelling stations completed in the last year alone. Revised projections, based on
improved understanding of issues facing certain station developers’ project timelines, show
37 stations total are expected to be open by the end of the year (including retail and non-retail)163.
According to Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (Air Products), one of the hydrogen suppliers to
California fuelling stations, the hydrogen supplied to the stations can be delivered to a site via truck or
pipeline164. It can also be produced by natural gas reformation; biomass conversion; or electrolysis,
including electrolysis driven by renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar.
In response to the development of hydrogen infrastructure in California, the following
announcements by the fuel cell and hydrogen industry were made in 2017, illustrating the expansion
of fuel cell and hydrogen technology in several transportation applications:


Honda’s 2017 Clarity fuel cell sedan launched in early 2017, with an estimated range of
590 kilometres (km). Honda and GM also established the auto industry’s first joint venture (JV) to
mass produce a HFC system for use in future products in both companies165. Hyundai and
Genesis unveiled a concept design for FCEVs, and Kia announced plans for bringing a new FCEV
model to the market in 2020166.



Air Products announced that it will now be able to offer hydrogen for FCEV fuelling at a price of
less than $10 per kilogram (kg) at its five stations in California167. Air Products cites advances in
fuelling station and hydrogen distribution technology, as well as projected FCEV deployments as
enabling factors in reaching this pricing milestone.



A 30 percent reduction in storage tank cost could be achieved by using a new steel hydrogen
storage tank product (developed by Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal Corporation) that
promises a cost savings compared to conventional carbon fibre-wrapped tanks168.



United Parcel Service (UPS) announced that its first prototype fuel cell extended-range delivery
van, developed in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), will be deployed in the
third quarter of 2017169.

4.9.1.2 Germany
According to a study that looked at the prospects of providing hydrogen as a fuel by 2050, hydrogen
could cover up to 40 percent of the demand for energy in Germany’s transport sector by 2050173.
Industry, science, and government have recognized the potential advantage of hydrogen and fuel cell
technology for clean mobility, and are working on the market preparation of these technologies
through strategic alliances. The National Organisation Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology (NOW) is
responsible for the coordination and management of the National Innovation Programme for
Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology (NIP) and the Electromobility Model Regions programme of the
Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure (BMVI)174, as follows:


NOW’s primary task is to initiate and evaluate projects, and bundle them in an appropriate manner
to benefit from potential synergies.



NOW also incorporate subjects, such as production technology, education and training, and
public relations, to raise the public profile of these technologies and related products.



NOW is also commissioned by the BMVI to support the continued development of the Mobility
and Fuel Strategy, as well as implement the EU Directive 2014/94/EU on the development of
alternative fuels infrastructure (CPT).

NOW is coordinating the development of 50 hydrogen refuelling stations within the scope of a
carefully monitored process. To support the rapid roll-out of refuelling station infrastructure in
metropolitan areas and along main transport roads, H2 Mobility (a JV founded by six industrial
partners, Air Liquide, Daimler, Linde, OMV, Shell, and TOTAL in 2015175) will establish and operate
the first 100 hydrogen refuelling stations by 2018 or 2019 unconditionally and irrespective of the
number of vehicles using the stations. This will mean developing up to 10 stations in each of 6 major
metropolitan areas in Germany (Hamburg, Berlin, Rhine-Ruhr, Frankfurt, Stuttgart, and Munich) and
establishing hydrogen corridors along motorways. The second phase of the project will be aligned

with the number of FCVs on the road. By 2023, a total of 400 refuelling stations would provide
nationwide coverage across Germany.
H2 Mobility receives funding from BMVI within the framework of the NIP, as well as from the European
Commission through the second phase of the FCHJU as part of the Hydrogen Mobility Europe
Project, and the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T CEF) as part of the Connecting Hydrogen
Refuelling Stations programme176.

4.9.1.3 South Korea177
The Korean Government has committed to building a national hydrogen infrastructure, pledging to
have 100 fuelling stations in operation by 2020 and 230 stations by 2025. Korean stations are fully
financed by the local and national governments, with local cities and regions owning and operating
them.
In June 2017, Nel ASA (Nel, a dedicated hydrogen company headquartered in Norway) entered into
an agreement with Deokyang Co., Korea’s largest hydrogen supplier, to establish a JV for exclusive
sale and marketing of Nel’s hydrogen fuelling stations in Korea.

4.9.1.4 Plan for Hydrogen Economy in Japan and South Australia
Japan178
First articulated in a 2014 blueprint, the vehicle and infrastructure advances would position hydrogen
at the centre of Japan’s everyday energy needs. The government envisions:


Small hydrogen plants at homes and businesses



A nationwide hydrogen distribution system



Big advances in deployment and scale that would dramatically reduce vehicle and fuel prices



The establishment of a carbon-free hydrogen manufacturing process

If the government’s plans succeed, there will be 800,000 FCEVs on Japanese roads by 2030
(compared with just 1,700 today) along with a network of 900 filling stations to serve them.
The government and industry are pushing together, with heavy subsidies flowing in support of
corporate hydrogen projects, and businesses fully committed to seeing the government's vision
through. One motivation for the collaboration is to raise Japan’s image as global clean-energy leaders
ahead of the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Another is the goal for energy independence in a
country that depends on imports for nearly all of its oil. Hydrogen holds special promise for resourcepoor Japan because it can be produced from a wide variety of sources, including natural gas, coal,
biomass, solar or wind power, nuclear power, and hydro stations.

South Australia179
On September 8, 2017, the South Australian Government announced a hydrogen roadmap for South
Australia. The government’s vision is to accelerate South Australia’s transition to a clean, safe, and
sustainable producer, consumer, and exporter of hydrogen. The government highlighted the
following actions that will be taken to support the hydrogen economy:


Support early investment in hydrogen infrastructure, including co-investment in a demonstration
project for hydrogen production and use under the $150 million Renewable Technology Fund;
create demand for hydrogen through government leadership; incentivize investment in hydrogen
infrastructure; and provide up-to-date information on the potential for hydrogen technology
projects.



Promote and enhance the attractiveness of head office location, equipment distribution, and
servicing and manufacturing in South Australia, including using the $200 million Future Jobs Fund
to target job creation in the emerging hydrogen sector, and encouraging automotive industry
diversification along the supply chain.



Deepen relationships with key trading partners, particularly with Asia-Pacific trading partners.



Unlock hydrogen innovation, including support for commercialization of home-grown
technologies, facilitation of research and industry partnerships, and continued encouragement in
developing clean technology and renewable energy expertise.



Create a strong regulatory framework for hydrogen production, storage, and use through
providing a fair, predictable, and trustworthy regulatory framework.

4.9.1.5 Conclusion
The hydrogen economy is envisioned as a truly sustainable energy system that, if the hydrogen is
produced from zero-emission energy sources, has the potential advantage of producing no harmful
emissions. A hydrogen supply chain is the cornerstone of any jurisdiction’s efforts to build a hydrogen
economy. Additionally, in all cases studied, government funding and policy has been essential to the
development of a hydrogen economy.
As other jurisdictions take steps to advance the use of hydrogen for transportation and industrial uses,
there is a real opportunity for Ontario to contribute to leading global innovation in the development
of the hydrogen supply chain and hydrogen-powered applications. To date, the focus of international
governments has been hydrogen applications related to passenger cars and other on-road vehicles,
but an opportunity exists for larger transportation applications.
If Ontario chooses Hydrail as the technology for the GO RER network, significant demand for the
hydrogen supply chain would be created immediately, unlike in other jurisdictions where demand is
expected to follow the supply of infrastructure. This, in addition to existing Canadian expertise in
hydrogen technology, could transform Ontario into a centre for hydrogen technology innovation
globally.

Overview of Hydrogen Related Businesses

Depending on the procurement approach that is adopted it is likely that a combination of an
industrial process contractor and a rail vehicle manufacturer will be responsible for designing and
building the Hydrail System.
The design and supply of Hydrail’s subsystems and components would be undertaken by specialist
businesses located in Ontario, Canada and throughout the world. As part of the feasibility study the
team spoke with and received information from a broad section of these businesses to understand
their current capabilities and their expectations of where their industry is headed.
All the businesses expressed a strong interest in being part of the Hydrail Program and confirmed
their capabilities and capacities to meet our potential requirements.
The table below contains a list of businesses that have capabilities in the following areas:


Supply and distribution of hydrogen;



Supply of tanks for the storage of liquid and gaseous hydrogen;



Supply of refuelling systems;



Supply of electrolyzers and fuel cells;



Supply of batteries;



Testing and systems integration services.

Some of the businesses are multi-national in size and provide services in Canada. Other businesses
are based in Canada (highlighted below in Table 4-49). These are all smaller in size, although
businesses such as Hydrogenics and Ballard have a global portfolio of completed and current
projects. However, for these Ontario and Canadian based companies to benefit from the
implementation of the Hydrail System there would be the need for them to expand their current
production capacities.
We believe that this is achievable given that there will be design and development phase of the
program that will last several years, however it is an area that we intend to investigate in more detail
during the next phase of the study.

Hydrogen Fuel Cell Rail Vehicle Market Maturity and
Trajectory

The maturity of HFC-powered rail vehicles has moved from chatter and speculation to become a
serious contender to wayside electrification and diesel power. Conversations about HFC rail vehicles
are also starting to shift away from lack of ready resources of hydrogen, performance and range
anxiety to project analysis and studies to deploy HFC locomotives in an effective manner.
Germany, for example, has started to invest in a hydrogen generation plant and hydrogen distribution
networks since 2002. The German government identified hydrogen and hydrogen-fuel-cell
technology as essential to the future of mobility and energy supply. In 2002, it established the Clean
Energy Partnership as a joint venture between government and industry to test the suitability of
hydrogen as a fuel. Germany, like Ontario, has an energy mix that favours green energy. Surplus
energy is continually used to generate hydrogen. In response to favourable market environments like
Germany, all over the world, major rail vehicle manufacturers have made significant investments in
HFC technology.
Alstom’s Coradia iLint is the most well-known example of a rail vehicle that uses HFC technology. The
Coradia iLint, successfully completed its test run on its own track in Salzgitter, Lower Saxony,
Germany. Alstom plans passenger test runs in early 2018. Several German states have signed letters
of intent to buy the trains once Alstom puts them into production which is expected to be in 2019.
East Japan Railway (JR) demonstrated the world’s first hydrogen hybrid commuter train to the public
in 2006. JR’s New Energy Train (NE Train) has two 65-kw PEM fuel cells and can travel up to 60 mph
for approximately 60 miles. The NE Train uses regenerative braking, common to hybrid cars, to
recharge the battery pack. In addition, the NE Train consumes 20 percent less fuel than traditional
trains. The NE Train was designed to travel to more remote regions of Japan that do not have
overhead power cables to replace both electric trains and diesel locomotives.180
More recently, Siemens and Ballard have partnered together to develop a fuel cell version of the
Siemens’ Mireo EMU. Ballard has also engaged with CCRC Tangshan to develop a hydrogen power
version of a LRV. Trials began on a dedicated test track in October 2017.181
BNSF Railway and Vehicle Projects converted a GG20B locomotive to an experimental testbed, for the
use of HFCs. The new locomotive was designated HH20B. The locomotive was publicly demonstrated
for the first time on June 29, 2009, at Topeka, Kansas and was built initially for the CP, but was not
delivered, due to the cancellation of the order. It was sold to BNSF in 2008, and shipped to the
railroad's shops at Topeka, Kansas for conversion. The diesel generator set was removed, and the fuel
cell power unit was installed in its place. Hydrogen storage is in a set of tanks installed in a heavily
vented enclosure on top of the locomotive's long hood, above the batteries.182
Sifang Co., a subsidiary of China South Rail Corporation (CSR) successfully presented the world's first
hydrogen-powered tramcar at an assembly facility in Qingdao. With over 60 seats and the ability to
carry up to 380 passengers, the tram can be refilled with hydrogen in only three minutes and can run
distances of up to 100 kilometers at a maximum speed of 70 kilometers per hour.183 184.

Commercial

This section seeks to identify options and a recommended approach to commercial structures and
procurement processes to support Hydrail deployment on the GO network. This entails an
assessment of the possible contractual arrangements for the following factors:


Purchase of rolling stock



Supply, generation, and transportation of hydrogen



Fuelling of trains



O&M of trains and train storage facilities



O&M of hydrogen generation and storage infrastructure

Consideration is given to appropriate risk transfer mechanisms and the effective bundling of services.
The section also contemplates the most effective procurement methods for the aforementioned
services, with a view to achieving the best value, as well as the impact on the existing plans for
procurement through RER Package 3.

4.10.1 Current RER Procurement Strategy and Impact of Hydrail
Delivering on RER plans will involve the procurement of services related to the operations and
maintenance of trains, services along the railway corridor (on-corridor), and services outside of the
corridor (off-corridor).
On-corridor works are primarily related to the installation of fixed infrastructure, such as
communications-based train control, signalling, radio and data communications, and track upgrades,
as well as maintenance of all elements. On-corridor works will also include the electrification of the
GO network, requiring the installation of overhead catenaries to allow for trains to be powered. The
associated capital costs are significant, including costs related to, inter alia, the relocation of utilities,
the acquisition of property access rights/property acquisition, environmental assessments and bridge
upgrades. The maintenance of the overhead catenary system will also cause further costs to be
incurred over the concession period. Off-corridor works are primarily related to upgrades to existing
stations and parking infrastructure, as well as the development of new stations and parking
infrastructure.
As currently envisioned, off-corridor works will be procured through separate contracts. Given the
complexity and inter-relation of train operations and on-corridor services, it has been recommended
that, in keeping with international best practices, train operation services and on-corridor works and
services will be delivered through a single, integrated design, build, finance, operate, maintain
(DBFOM) contract.
While Metrolinx will continue to be responsible for customer facing activities, the on-corridor
concessionaire (OnCo) will be responsible for the operation and maintenance of trains. OnCo will
procure electric train sets and undertake the necessary on-corridor infrastructure works. At a defined
date following award of the DBFOM contract, OnCo will also take over the operation and
maintenance of existing trains, and on a go-forward basis, be responsible for the operation and
maintenance of trains along with on-corridor infrastructure.
Within the context of the current RER procurement plans, Hydrail can create both opportunities and
risks/costs. Some of the key features of the existing procurement plans and the related impact of
Hydrail are discussed in the following sections.

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

4.10.1.1 On-Corridor Works
Procurement
Based on current electrification plans, the capital cost of the on-corridor infrastructure works is
estimated at $7B, with a further CAPEX on rolling stock of $2B. Some parts of the work are being
procured and constructed in advance of the commencement of the DBFOM contract. The size of the
capital infrastructure in the proposed DBFOM contract will therefore likely constrain the field of
bidders that will be able to meet the requirements of Metrolinx and finance providers to secure
construction performance for a project of this magnitude. Further to this, over the proposed 30-year
concession period, the DBFOM contract will require flexibility to accommodate changes in service
levels and the service plan.
A decision to pursue Hydrail could eliminate the requirement to install overhead catenary wires,
resulting in a significant reduction in the overall on-corridor project scope and cost. This cost saving
may be partially offset by the additional costs of establishing a hydrogen supply chain. However, the
hydrogen supply chain capital costs would lie outside the RER DBFOM contract, and the reduction in
the DBFOM capital costs could potentially allow for a greater number of bidders who could meet the
necessary construction security requirements, thereby providing an opportunity for increased
competition.
Though the scope of the DBFOM contract would be reduced with the pursuit of Hydrail, Hydrail and
the use of HFC technology presents enhanced technology risk relative to overhead electrification.
While this risk may, at least partially, be passed on to the ProjectCo, proponents will assign a value to
the risk they are assuming and ultimately incorporate this value in their bids. Further to this, there are
likely to be less companies interested in taking on the level of technology risk presented, which could
limit the field of bidders.
System Service Specifications
The RER system service specifications will define, inter alia, capacity, service frequency and average
journey times. Service levels will be set based on Metrolinx’s projections over the concession period.
The service specifications will provide the framework in which OnCo proponents will decide the
infrastructure and rolling stock that will allow for a maximum service level to be achieved. It is
expected that the project agreement will allow Metrolinx to purchase capacity and train service levels
based on its projections, on which basis OnCo will procure and commission the required rolling stock
and infrastructure. It is expected that OnCo will design infrastructure to meet the projected 2044
service requirements. The associated capital costs would be paid over the concession period through
availability payments.
Service levels could be varied at Metrolinx’ discretion with appropriate notice to OnCo. Capacity
levels could be increased with appropriate notice. This will allow Metrolinx to determine the pace at
which infrastructure will be expanded/upgraded and allow flexibility in train service levels over the
concession period. The pursuit of Hydrail will likely create greater flexibility for Metrolinx to increase
the system’s capacity level, as less changes would be required to fixed infrastructure. In this case,
increasing the system’s ability to supply increased power to trains is expected to be a simpler and less
expensive process than it would be in the case of overhead electrification.
Procurement Timeline
A Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for the DBFOM contract is expected to be issued in Spring 2018,
and the Request for Proposals (RFP) issued later that year. Financial close is anticipated in 2019, after
which OnCo is expected to begin on-corridor infrastructure works and the procurement of rolling

stock. OnCo is expected to assume current operations at a defined date after 2021 and to provide the
upgraded RER service delivery to various corridors commencing in 2024.
The current procurement timeline is somewhat aggressive, noting significant works to be completed
in the installation of overhead catenaries. These works will also involve significant third party and
public interface, given the need to obtain environmental approvals, relocate utilities, upgrade
bridges, remove trees and obtain property rights. Additionally, there are potentially significant
scheduling risks associated with the installation of overhead catenary wires.
While Hydrail will eliminate the need for the infrastructure works associated with the installation of
overhead catenary wires, additional scheduling risks are presented because hydrogen fuel powered
train sets that meet RER requirements do not currently exist. Based on initial market consultations, it is
however, anticipated that train sets could be designed and delivered within the planned timeline for
RER implementation.

4.10.1.2 Off Corridor Works
The procurement of off-corridor works is ongoing and includes platform construction or upgrades as
well as the acquisition of land to house new stations or facilitate the expansion of, or changes to,
existing stations.
The procurement of off corridor works will be impacted by any changes to train configuration. Such a
change could be required if, for example, it is determined that, due to the need for on-board fuel
storage, there is the need for longer trains, or for the trains’ floors to be at a different height than is
currently the case. In such an event, passenger platforms would have to be adjusted to facilitate safe
boarding of passengers. It is however noted that Metrolinx may have a preference to adjust platform
heights anyway to provide for level boarding.
A decision to pursue Hydrail would also necessitate the construction of hydrogen generation, storage,
transportation and dispensing infrastructure. This will require additional land acquisition and the
design and construction of these facilities. Consideration will also have to be given to operation and
maintenance of these facilities, noting that fuelling infrastructure is not contemplated under current
RER procurement plans. It is noted, as discussed in Section 4.9, that hydrogen generation and storage
facilities at the scale or functionality level required to support the GO network do not currently exist.

4.10.1.3 Rail Vehicle Maintenance Facilities
Rail vehicle maintenance facilities allow for the mechanical maintenance, body repair, the day-to-day
cleaning of trains and operational services such as fuelling and sanding. There is currently one train
maintenance facility, the Willowbrook facility, located in Etobicoke, ON. A second facility, the East Rail
Maintenance Facility, is currently under construction as a design, build, finance, maintain (DBFM)
project, with substantial completion scheduled for December 2017. OnCo is expected to take over
use of the maintenance facilities in 2021.
The maintenance requirements of hydrogen fuelled vehicles will differ from those of electric or diesel
vehicles. A key consideration will be that maintenance facilities for hydrogen fuelled vehicles should
allow for greater levels of ventilation. Other health and safety concerns would have to be addressed,
as appropriate and required. Notwithstanding this, it is anticipated that these concerns can be
addressed without any significant structural changes being required.

4.10.2 Jurisdictional Scan
The following sections provides an overview of recent examples of the deployment of vehicle fleets
fuelled alternative fuels. The examples offer some insight into the commercial considerations of other
jurisdictions as they sought to diversify their fuel mix, in the provision of public transportation services.
Though, with one the exception, these are not examples of hydrogen powered rail, they provide
examples of approaches to the introduction of alternative fuels in public transportation fleets. The risk
profiles associated with these initiatives are therefore, relevant as we examine the commercial
considerations for Hydrail in Ontario.

4.10.2.1 Hydrail Deployment – The German Example
The German government has taken steps to electrify parts of its rail network using HFC technology. As
at March 2017, the German states of Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Baden-Württemberg and
the Hessian transport association ‘Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund’185 had signed letters of intent to
purchase a total of 60 trains from Alstom, an integrated rail transport company. While there are
limited public details of the procurement activities to date, in the study conducted to assess the
feasibility of the use of HFC to propel trains in Germany, recommendations were made for the
procurement of services.
The study highlighted the provision of hydrogen infrastructure as a new service component, which
would not have had to be considered with more conventional railway service models. Two options,
integrated or separate procurement of train services and hydrogen infrastructure, were considered.
The models were analyzed within the context of appropriate distribution of risks between the
commissioning authority and the transport and infrastructure companies. Acknowledging that there
was no precedent on which to base an assessment, the models considered were intended to illustrate
the spectrum of conceivable procurement possibilities.
Option 1 - Separate Procurement of Train Services and Hydrogen Infrastructure
Two of the models considered for separate procurement of train services and hydrogen infrastructure
are outlined below.

Conventional Vehicle Procurement
In this model, the provision, maintenance and repair of vehicles as well as the transport service is
undertaken by the rail transport company. The supply of hydrogen is procured separately.
The advantages of the model are that transport services are provided by one integrated company and
there is the generation of service and value chain synergies through the rail transport company, while
the commissioning body profits from market knowledge of the rail transport company. A key
disadvantage is that there are high market entry hurdles, which could preclude small and mediumsized rail transport companies.
Given the higher capital costs, and to facilitate competition, the study suggested that the
commissioning authority consider providing various forms of support to the rail transportation
company, including a reauthorization guarantee, a redeployment guarantee (vehicles), the retention
of interest rate risk, a capital service guarantee, a residual value guarantee, or some combination of
these.

Commissioning Authority Vehicle Pool
In this model, the commissioning authority would procure vehicles, separately from the rail transport
company procurement, and maintain them in a pool. Vehicles would then be made available to the
rail transport company, as scheduled, over the concession period.
The key advantage of this model is that the commissioning authority stands to benefit from
economies of scale by ordering trains in larger quantities. The rail transport company also benefits as
the commissioning authority would maintain residual value risk.
The key disadvantage is that the commissioning authority maintains the risks associated with the
vehicles, including technology risk, which is more significant in the case of HFC-powered trains.
Further to this, the commissioning authority does not benefit from the experience of the rail transport
company in the procurement of the trains.
Option 2 - Integrated procurement of train services and hydrogen infrastructure
Two of the models considered for integrated procurement of train services and hydrogen
infrastructure are outlined below.

The LNVG H2 Model
This model is based on the planned procurement of services for Hydrail by
Landesnahverkehrgesellschaft Niedersachsen mbH (LNVG), the state local public transport company
of Lower Saxony. In this model, the provision of trains and hydrogen infrastructure were bundled into
one procurement package, while rail transport services were intended to be procured separately.
The provision of trains and hydrogen infrastructure along with the related services by one entity
reduces the risks to which the commissioning authority is exposed. Additionally, as in the
Commissioning Authority Vehicle Pool, the commissioning authority is likely to benefit from
economies of scale in procuring trains in larger quantities. The significant disadvantages are however,
the reduction in the competitive field, loss of the benefit of the experience of the rail transport
company in the vehicle procurement process, and the retention of certain risks associated with the
vehicle procurement, such as technology risk.

The H2 Service Model
The H2 Service Model builds on the LNVG H2 model by bundling rail transport operations with the
provision of trains and hydrogen infrastructure, along with the related services. The benefits of the
LNVG H2 model are enhanced. In particular, the commissioning authority can transfer all risks related
to the vehicle procurement to a fully integrated services provider. However, given the scale of the
procurement package and the inherent risks, the primary disadvantage is that there is likely to be an
even greater reduction in the competitive field.

4.10.2.2 Hydrogen in Canadian Transit Fleets
In 2010, BC Transit launched what was at the time the world’s largest fleet of HFC-powered buses186.
The project was jointly funded by the federal government and the Province of British Columbia. The
fleet of 20 fuel cell electric buses were integrated into regular service operations in Whistler, British
Columbia. The buses were supplied by Winnipeg bus manufacturer New Flyer, while the fuel cells and
batteries were provided by Ballard. Air Liquide was contracted to supply hydrogen and the company
was initially expected to construct a 1,000-kg hydrogen fuelling station in Whistler. The station never
materialized and instead, hydrogen was trucked from Quebec, leading to higher costs and

significantly higher GHG emissions than anticipated. In 2014, BC Transit issued a request for offers to
purchase the vehicles, which were reported to have cost three times more in maintenance and fuel
costs than the diesel buses they had replaced.187

4.10.2.3 The Hydrogen Highway – California188 189 190 191
The CaH2Net is an initiative of the State of California in the USA to promote the use of hydrogen as a
fuel in transportation, thereby diversifying energy sources while ensuring environmental and
economic benefits to the state. An economic report prepared as part of the development of the
state’s hydrogen blueprint concluded that the early risks related to the development of hydrogen
fueled vehicles and products must be shared between government and the private sector.
Through a bill passed in 2005, funding was provided to co-fund up to three demonstration hydrogen
fuelling stations, purchase or lease up to two hydrogen internal combustion engine shuttle buses and
lease a fleet of up to twelve hydrogen fuelled vehicles.
A Request for Proposal (RFP) was issued to solicit competitive bids from qualified teams or individuals
including energy suppliers, original equipment manufacturers, utilities, contractors and other parties
interested in further developing and demonstrating hydrogen refuelling infrastructure in California.
The fuelling stations which were to be open to the public, were intended to demonstrate and test the
viability of the use of hydrogen as a transportation fuel.
The state committed to funding 50 percent of the cost of each station, with the state’s contribution to
be used in part, to help offset and provide incentives for the increased capital outlay and engineering
required to meet the emissions targets and new renewable energy requirement. The stations, once
completed, were required to be in operation for a minimum of two years, after which all capital
equipment paid for by state funds would become the property of the operator/successful bidder,
leaving the state with no financial or intellectual interest in the station.
An RFP was issued to solicit viable businesses with a proven track record and a demonstrated ability
to provide proven hydrogen fuelled vehicles. The vehicles, which were to be leased for a 24-month
period, were intended to demonstrate the viability of hydrogen as a fuel in transportation and of
hydrogen vehicles. The vehicles would be used in areas where they could facilitate public
demonstration, data collection and reporting requirements. The areas would have to be near
hydrogen fuelling stations and allow for sufficient travelling miles to be accumulated. The lessor
would be required to supply a new vehicle, facilitate driver training, provide educational materials and
safety information, and maintain the vehicles.
The state continues to fund new hydrogen fuelling stations. To date, the state has co-funded
62 hydrogen fuelling stations across California. Through Assembly Bill No. 8, up to $20M per year is
dedicated to support continued construction of at least 100 hydrogen fuel stations.

4.10.3 Considerations for structuring commercial arrangements
As noted in Section 4.9, the hydrogen industry, including the generation, storage, transportation and
dispensing of hydrogen is well developed globally; however, the hydrogen dispensing technology is
not at the stage to allow for the dispensing of hydrogen at the rate required to support Hydrail on the
GO network. Further to this, while the industry is well developed at large scale globally and in western
Canada, there is no significant activity in Ontario. Building this industry to support Hydrail in Ontario is
a critical factor to ensuring successful implementation. In respect of rolling stock, though there have
been some advances in the development of hydrogen powered rail vehicles, there are currently no
known cases of the development of hydrogen powered rail vehicles that can meet the performance
specifications of RER. There are many considerations along with options for proposed actions that
require further exploration if the Hydrail concept is pursued further by Metrolinx.
The entire supply chain or system model components that will be explored in this section are shown in
the CNL figure (Figure 4-48).

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

The following sections below provide commercial considerations on each of the components that
must be explored further to make Hydrail a functional option for Metrolinx. For the purposes of this
Report, the components have been broken down and examined in two groupings:
1. Grid Interface, Hydrogen Production, Storage, Distribution and Dispensing
2. Hydrail Rolling Stock, Operations and Maintenance of Rolling Stock and Related Maintenance
Facilities
These groupings were chosen due to the natural business lines between fuel supply chain and vehicle
supply and operations. One consortium of various firms may be able to manage the entire supply
chain in Figure 4-48, plus operations and maintenance of rolling stock; however, this will depend on
the procurement model chosen and market acceptability. This will be explored in the Procurement
Factors section below. A further separation of the supply chain, for the purposes of this Report, was
believed to lead to both inefficiencies and additional interface risks for Metrolinx, which together
negatively impact the availability of the fuel for operational needs and therefore, the success of the
program.

4.10.4 Grid Interface, Hydrogen Production, Storage, Distribution
and Dispensing
Ensuring that Hydrail will work and provide desired benefits is the first step to seeing progress;
however, for hydrogen-fueled vehicles to be successful long term on the Go network there needs to
be a strong and clear commercial foundation in place. Also, this option must be competitive and
ultimately comparable to the electrification option, while also delivering on long-term, desired
environmental benefits.
Hydrogen-powered public transit has been explained as technologically feasible by various entities
that contributed to development of this Report, but it is still unclear if the long-term costs of supplying
these non-conventional services on a very large scale are comparable to the cost of more proven
technologies for public transit elsewhere in Canada. The reality is that this uncertainty adds an
incremental level of risk not commonly seen on electrified rail or diesel locomotives for a
programming perspective (that is, will levels of service be met over time?).
These realities do not mean that Hydrail is not possible. Rather, it is extremely important to fully
understand various business factors and develop a comprehensive strategy to ensure successful
advancement of the initiative. The following section provides details on the various business factors
identified and discussed during the development of this Report.

4.10.4.1 Business Factors
While hydrogen generation, storage and transportation facilities exists in Canada, they largely
support industrial activities, with little application in transportation. One notable example of the
application of hydrogen as a fuel in Ontario is CTC’s recent pilot project to generate hydrogen on site
and use the fuel to power Brampton Distribution Centre forklifts. Due to the success of this pilot
project, this technology has also been incorporated into the new Bolton Distribution Centre in the
Town of Caledon. This application is however at a much smaller scale than required to support
Hydrail.
There is more hydrogen-powered transportation expertise worldwide (for example, Germany and
Japan), which Ontario may learn from; however, capacity and expertise for the scale envisioned to
support the GO network is not believed to be present in these markets either at this time. Aside from

the general state of the business, there are other specific considerations that should be addressed
prior to proceeding (Table 4-50).
TABLE 4-50 BUSINESS FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN DEPLOYING THE HYDRAIL SYSTEM FOR GO
Category
Grid Interface

Factor for Consideration
The availability of electricity to generate
hydrogen fuel must be a key consideration
for a potential Hydrail solution on the GO
network.
Electricity usage may fluctuate over time,
but is expected to remain quite constant
once processes are developed and the level
of service is determined.

Hydrogen Production

Electricity cost is important due to the high
need for power to complete the electrolysis
process and Metrolinx should further assess
the opportunities and risk of electricity costs
changing over time

Potential Steps/Options
A good understanding of capacity and volume
risk for electricity along the corridor is required,
including appropriate mitigation measures. This
may be completed in a separate study that
should include:


Finding ideal locations for generation facilities
(large and/or localized) where there is either
existing capacity or opportunity for new
capacity to be added to the grid at a low cost.



Consider bulk power purchasing agreements
once a range of volume need is known,
particularly if government is to assume risk for
the volume of electricity required to produce
hydrogen fuel.



Consider passing the risk of electricity volume
to a private partner, either through an AFP
contract or other contracting arrangement
o On previous AFP contracts, electricity
volume risk has been shared with the
private partner

Explore opportunities and reasonability to use
off-peak electricity for Hydrail with specific
consideration given to cost per megawatt and
meeting service level needs (i.e., will off-peak
electricity save substantial money, and what is the
long-term potential of this electricity staying
relatively inexpensive).
Currently, optimistic estimates for electricity are
$46 per MWh, but may range as high as $76 per
MWh.
It is unlikely that a private partner would take
pricing risk for electricity (unless increased costs
could be at least partially passed on to
government), regardless of the procurement
model; however, market sounding on this point
could be undertaken.

Hydrogen Production

CPG-PGM-RPT-245
DATE: 02/02/2018

A constant supply of water for the hydrolysis
process is also necessary and although this
is not anticipated to be a major concern for
supply and pricing, analysis is still required
to ensure risks are understood and the
technical solution is achievable within any
related constraints (i.e., if local water supply
is available)

232

Discussions with local municipal organizations is
essential to accurately forecast availability and
cost of water for the electrolysis process.

TABLE 4-50 BUSINESS FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN DEPLOYING THE HYDRAIL SYSTEM FOR GO
Category
Hydrogen Production,
Storage, Distribution
& Refuelling

Factor for Consideration
There are two main options for hydrogen
production (with potential for a hybrid
model) that each come with opportunities
and challenges:
1.

2.

Hydrogen Production,
Storage, Distribution
& Refuelling

Centralized production – A large facility
or facilities capable of efficiently
producing hydrogen in large quantities
o The facility can be located where
electricity, water and land is
available – reducing short-term
costs
o Requires transport of fuel via truck
or pipeline to where the fuel is
needed for refilling stations
o Interface risk exists, as the fuel is
required to be moved longer
distances
o Pipelines are expensive and may
not be able to be built within the
existing right of way or through
well-developed commercial and
residential communities
o Trucking the fuel will at least
partially offset GHG emission
reductions (assuming trucks use
fossil fuels), which is a desired
outcome of RER

Potential Steps/Options
Metrolinx needs to determine the best approach
from cost, risk, strategy and various other
perspectives. Depending on the scale of Hydrail
relative to the entire GO network (e.g., pilot
program, only part of the network or the entire
network), the generation and distribution options
may become clearer.
CTC recognized benefits of an on-site hydrogen
generation solution, which has now been
replicated at a second warehouse location. This
being said, the scale of their operation is
estimated at approximately <1 percent of the
scale contemplated on the GO network (i.e., 200
to 300 kg of hydrogen per day vs. 40 tonnes per
day).
Understanding opportunities for land acquisition
for both options is critical, particularly for the
decentralized option where production facilities
would be located near existing, busier stations
along the corridor. From a business perspective,
it will be difficult to transfer land acquisition risk
to the private partner for this government
initiative, especially since government has
expropriation rights that can be triggered if
required.

Decentralized production – Many
localized generation facilities that are
located at or near the sites that require
the fuel
o There is limited need for
distribution of the fuel, reducing
cost and GHGs or transport
o Land acquisition is required at sites
near where fuelling of trains is
required
o Inefficiencies of production and
staffing may result

Technical labour supply is anticipated to be
limited outside of research facilities and
smaller industrial competencies. There may
be some transferrable knowledge from
other related industries (e.g., industrial
natural gas) that will lessen the impact of this
potential issue; however, that is yet to be
determined.

There will be a need to educate technicians to
operate and maintain the hydrogen fuel supply
chain and also HFC-powered rail vehicles. This
may not be a risk that can be adequately
transferred to a private partner; however, market
sounding may provide more details. This needs
to be explored further depending on the
feasibility and related scale of Hydrail on the GO
network.
Some colleges in Canada and the United States
have existing programs or have started to plan
for future programming to train employees for
this industry. One example is Stark College in

Potential Steps/Options
Ohio, which has a program for Fuel Cell
Technology. Further, colleges in Canada have
recently facilitated forums or meetings related to
hydrogen fuel technology, including Canadore
College in North Bay, Ontario and Red River
College in Manitoba.
Partnerships and funding (public and private) to
support skills training in this industry is crucial to
ensure the skills and abilities exist for an initiative
as large as Hydrail on the GO network.

General - Regulatory

The CHIC falls under the TSSA; however,
this regulatory framework does not seem to
accommodate hydrogen powered trains on
a large scale. Without an adequate
regulatory framework, it will be difficult for
companies to assume risk on this type of
venture.

Engagement with Transport Canada is believed
to be underway with CNL providing advice on
safety and other related factors. Currently, there
is no regulatory framework in place for hydrogen
powered trains and the timeline is unclear. A plan
of action, including for required consultations
and engagement with involved agencies, should
be developed and actioned.
There have been licences granted in Canada for
hydrogen powered equipment, including forklifts
and vehicles (e.g., buses). This will provide a
baseline for future work in the area.

4.10.5 Hydrail Rolling Stock, Operations and Maintenance of Rolling
Stock and Related Maintenance Facilities
The Ontario Ministry of Transportation and Metrolinx recently issued an RFP to allow various rail
vehicle manufacturers to develop designs and determine the overall impacts on the addition of fuel
cell technology on BL trains. The focus of this procurement was on how this relatively new technology
may impact the overall RER business case, service delivery and ultimately the performance of the GO
network. Responses have recently been received and are being evaluated by government officials.
The results of this process, which are still unknown, are expected to lead into the planning of an
integrated DBFOM procurement should Hydrail be considered a potential technical solution for the
RER Strategy.
Although the results of this process may add clarity to what options exist for rolling stock, there are
other commercial considerations as well. These are explored further below.

4.10.5.1 Business Factors
Hydrogen powered vehicles are a relatively new concept compared to other traditional methods,
primarily fossil-fuel (that is, diesel) public transportation vehicles. Though on a relatively small scale,
there are many examples of the application in buses, particularly in Europe and in California. Also,
current plans are being implemented in Japan for over 100 Toyota hydrogen powered buses for the
Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. There are no examples of hydrogen fuelled trains in commercial
operation.
Aside from the current state of business for hydrogen powered vehicles, there are other specific
considerations that should be addressed as Hydrail is contemplated for the GO network (Table 4-51).

Factor for Consideration

Potential Steps/Options

Hydrogen Vehicle

Lack of competition for the manufacturing,
operations and maintenance of hydrogen
powered trains could leave government in a
difficult business position. Depending on the
structure of related procurement processes,
this could lead to limited competition and price
or quality risk for government.
Based on research completed to date, Alstom
is the only company advanced in the
manufacturing of HFC passenger trains,
although Siemens recently announced a train
development agreement with fuel cell
company, Ballard. Further, Alstom’s current
hydrogen powered rolling stock is in the pilot
project stage, has not been proven for widescale use and is a different train set compared
to requirements planned to date for Metrolinx.
It is also important to note that European rail
manufacturers Alstom and Siemens have
announced intentions to merge operations. It is
unclear what this means for the hydrogen
powered train program in Germany.

Hydrail pilot projects could be possible on
sections of the GO network that are more difficult
for overhead electrification (should electrification
be chosen as the preferred option). Ideally, this
would occur once existing diesel locomotives are
nearing the end of their useful lives. This might
include Milton and Richmond Hill sections due to
physical restrictions and potential environmental
and stakeholder concerns.
This approach would allow for a phased-in
approach to hydrogen powered rail and also lead
to a more organic development of the related
industry in Canada on a larger scale than currently
exists.
If Hydrail is chosen as either a potential or
preferred model for the entire GO network, some
or all of these risks may be able to be transferred
to a private partner(s), depending on the
procurement model chosen. A market sounding
would be required to determine what may be
acceptable to industry. Also, depending on the
results of the recent RFP issued, which asked rail
vehicle manufacturers to develop Hydrail options,
these risks may be mitigated.

Timing of
Hydrogen Vehicle
Introduction

Useful life still exists on existing diesel
locomotives in the GO fleet and it is planned
that any private partner would assume
responsibility for these locomotives

Opportunity to phase-in a new approach (e.g.,
electrification or Hydrail) may be considered so
that priority segments are completed in early
phases and lesser priorities are completed in the
future. This will allow for lessons learned to be
applied on future phases. The structuring of
procurement may still allow for one consortium to
complete all phases or for phases to be split up to
allow for increased competitive tension in the
market.

Hydrogen Vehicle
Operations

To ensure that Metrolinx operations are not
interrupted, a constant, uninterrupted fuel
supply is required by the vehicle operator. It is
unlikely that there will be another hydrogen
fuel provider outside of this initiative that will be
able to provide the large scale of fuel required
daily to ensure no loss of service.

Control for on-site hydrogen storage, dispensing
and refuelling may be best placed at the operator
level; however, there would still not be a
guarantee that interface risk won’t occur. A plan
for redundancy in the case that hydrogen fuel not
be available should be developed.

The East Rail and Eglinton Crosstown
Maintenance Facilities are examples of recent
capital investments made by Metrolinx to
improve maintenance of rolling stock. These
facilities have not been designed to
accommodate Hydrail and the cost and impact
on timeline of retrofits, if required, is unknown.

A report detailing the impact of Hydrail on existing
maintenance facilities should be completed. This
would include an understanding of costs and
timelines associated with improvements (e.g.,
mechanical, electrical, safety).

Alternatively, full integration of the supply chain
identified in Figure 4-48 could be accomplished
with one large procurement with the risk of fuel
not being available being fully passed to the
private partner.

This may not be an issue; however, to date there is
a lack of clarity on this potential issue.

4.10.6 Procurement Factors
Innovation through procurement is essential for governments to obtain the best value for money on
major initiatives like the RER strategy. Allowing the private sector to determine the best solution for
meeting certain program and service level needs, within performance specifications to be developed
by government, has proven to produce positive results across various infrastructure types and
jurisdictions. Applying these same principles to rolling stock and associated infrastructure throughout
the GO network is an option that may be pursued, depending on the results of discussions with
industry.
If Project Specific Output Specifications (PSOS) are drafted to allow Hydrail approaches to meet
government’s needs, rather than specify that certain technologies must or must not be used, there will
be room for innovative and cost-effective approaches that capture the purchase, operations,
maintenance of rolling stock and infrastructure (for example, supply chain for hydrogen fuel or
electrification of the network) required to make the system function long term.
The alternative would be to specify the type of technology or particular approach to infrastructure that
must be used either for the entire GO network or for particular sections. This can be done through a
traditional (that is, Design-Bid-Build) procurement model or also by tightening performance
specifications in such a way that only one solution may be technically compliant during evaluation.
Although this approach may be required in certain unique circumstances (for example, requirement
to meet legislation or stakeholder concerns), industry will be constrained in their approaches to
innovation the more constraints that are put on the procurement parameters.
This typically has the impact of increased timeline and cost, which ultimately reduces value for money
long term.

4.10.6.1 Procurement and Project Objectives
Major capital initiatives like the RER strategy have focussed on determining what desired outcomes
are for a successful procurement. The intent is to choose the right tools that will ultimately offer a
highly effective solution to meeting both short and long-term needs of the organization. The first step
of this process is typically to develop project and procurement objectives, which provide a high-level
indication of considerations and constraints specific to the Project, which would be used to assess the
strategic alignment of different procurement options available to Metrolinx. The information below
provides an example of what these objectives might look like for RER.
Project Objectives


The desired public transit service objectives



To comply with affordability criteria



Financial and planning flexibility regarding long term strategic objectives



The nature of the assets and services to be delivered (longevity and quality)



Value engineering or innovation provided by the private sector



Local contractor involvement in the Project and the extent to which training and education
opportunities are provided

Procurement Objectives


The degree of participation in the procurement process and the competition generated



The fairness and transparency of the process



The extent to which Metrolinx receives schedule and cost certainty from the private sector
contractors



The ability to optimally allocate risk between the government and private sector



Ability to ensure no loss of service and to limit risk to government



Compliance with existing trade agreements (for example, Agreement on Internal Trade)

It is important to note that these have not been discussed with Metrolinx to date and are only
provided to illustrate how organizational objectives may impact the procurement model that is
ultimately chosen. Analysis is typically undertaken, beginning with a workshop setting, to narrow
down options to those that will delivered on desired outcomes.

4.10.6.2 Procurement options – Hydrail focus
There are numerous procurement options that may be considered for delivery of a Hydrail solution,
should this be chosen as a possible technical solution to meet Metrolinx’s long-term needs. These
options should be developed based on the size of the project scope, timeline considerations,
optimization of risk transfer, value for money and other objectives.
Various funding mechanisms have been explored in other similar studies (for example, CaH2Net),
including market-based concepts, subsidization of industry often through tax breaks and/or grants to
allow for development, sole-source mandates for a period of time until an industry is mature and
other reinforcing approaches like financial or non-financial awards and incentives. Although these
models may be successful in some instances, they are not believed to be applicable for what
Metrolinx is working towards accomplishing on the GO network. There may be potential however for
certain funding mechanisms to be used on smaller scope items connected to the initiative (for
example, licences to sell hydrogen to other customers beyond Metrolinx).
Although many options exist, for the purposes of this report, there are two potential procurement
approaches that are explored further as potential options to meet known objectives. This analysis is
not intended to be comprehensive in nature, as limited information still exists; however, it does
provide an indication of potential solutions for incorporating Hydrail into the RER strategy. Further
discussion and analysis will be required depending on the outcome of this Report.
Option 1: Broadened Output Specifications on Integrated DBFOM to Accommodate Hydrail
It may not be good practice to choose between overhead electrification and Hydrail at this point in
the project, but instead allow the market some flexibility to determine best value within certain
government established parameters (that is, PSOS during procurement). Recent decisions have been
made to undertake an Integrated DBFOM procurement, rather than separating the infrastructure from
the rolling stock and operator. This is an opportunity for Hydrail, since the infrastructure required for
the supply chain is integral to the operations of the rolling stock.
Unless the Government of Ontario plans to use Hydrail as a catalyst to build the hydrogen
transportation industry to support a larger Province-wide strategy, the procurement can be structured
to allow for various technical solutions within defined PSOS. These specifications (and proposal
evaluation criteria) can focus on maximum GHG emissions, noise, land available, level of service
requirements (for example, trip time, passenger volume), safety requirements, as well as price, and
many other important factors.

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

As the indicative design is being developed in advance of release of an RFP, considerations would
need to be given to Hydrail to ensure the PSOS are broad enough to allow for related innovations.
Examples include ensuring land availability for certain elements of the hydrogen production,
developing an appropriate regulatory framework for Hydrail and assisting with skilled workforce
development through universities and colleges.
Private sector consortiums bidding on the RFP would then determine the best approaches, including
both Hydrail and electrification, to ensure technical compliance. A Project affordability ceiling (based
on the indicative design) would be another key constraint outside of technical compliance. Metrolinx
would need to be more open to innovations under this approach and the market would likely need to
be accepting of more risk associated with technology, operations, land acquisition, stakeholder
consultation and other items. This is because Metrolinx cannot assume direct risk that a private sector
innovation (beyond what is proposed in the indicative design) will not function as planned to provide
the intended service or outcomes that are acceptable to stakeholders and the general public.
A potential variation of this option would be to have two or more separate DBFOM procurements;
however, due to the potential for interface risk and the decision to proceed with an integrated
DBFOM procurement, this option was not explored further in the Report.
Ultimately, this option provides flexibility for the market to determine the most appropriate solution
instead of government dictating that overhead electrification or Hydrail is the desired solution. The
following are potential pros and cons of this approach (Table 4-52).
TABLE 4-52 BROADENING OUTPUT SPECIFICATIONS ON INTEGRATED DBFOM TO ACCOMMODATE
HYDRAIL
Pros

Cons

Decisions and associated risks on overhead electrification
vs. Hydrail are shared with the private sector, rather than
assumed 100 percent by government

If Hydrail was considered a catalyst for further hydrogen
industry development, this may not occur

Innovation often leads to lower costs and increased value
for money for the same quality of service envisioned

More time may be required to broaden PSOS to allow for
Hydrail, which could delay the planned schedule

Stakeholder consultation risk is shared with a private sector
partner, as the technology decision is not the sole
responsibility of government

Some planning (e.g., preparation of stations for overhead
electrification, land acquisition assumptions) may become
redundant depending on the solution chosen

A broadened PSOS may lead to increased industry
competition (that is, not only companies that have
experience with overhead electrification)

There is increased pressure on government to come up
with PSOS that are broad enough to allow for innovation

It should be noted that even if Hydrail is chosen as the preferred technology option on which the
indicative design would be based upon, a broadened PSOS may still be a good procurement
strategy. Innovations outside of existing technical or business assumptions may be possible with a
more flexible approach to procurement of an initiative that is as complicated and unprecedented as
the RER strategy.
Option 2: Hydrail Pilot Projects
Other jurisdictions, specifically Germany, have decided to run pilot projects for new technologies
such as hydrogen powered rail projects to determine feasibility for broader application in the future.
This approach not only allows for adequate testing of a new and mostly unproven technology (that is,
for rail transportation) prior to a larger program-wide implementation, but also allows for time to
develop public acceptability of the technology and overall industry maturity.

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

From a procurement standpoint, there several ways that pilot projects can be approached and
implemented. Commitments recently made by the Ontario government have discounted the
possibility of undertaking Hydrail pilot projects prior to proceeding with the electrification of the
entire GO network. Therefore, Hydrail pilot projects may be best suited for sections of the GO
network that are not easily electrified for various reasons, including flooding and stakeholder
concerns. These are sections where diesel locomotives may be the natural alternative if overhead
electrification is not possible or desirable. This approach, although workable from a level of service
perspective, is not believed to be aligned to the Province’s low emissions goals.
Hydrail pilot projects may be procured separately or as a package under various models using more
traditional approaches where full design is completed or various AFP approaches. These
procurement options have not been analyzed in detail for this Report; however, risk transfer with the
private delivery partner may be better suited for a packaged DBFOM, rather than more traditional
design, bid, build (DBB).
These potential pilot projects may also be considered for integration with the larger integrated
DBFOM strategy, but further analysis and discussion with industry and stakeholders would be
required before this approach was considered. Since Project Co. is expected to take over
responsibility of the existing Metrolinx fleet currently servicing the GO network, this approach may
provide the best opportunity for innovation and incorporation of leading asset management practices
(that is, using the diesel locomotives until replacement is required for asset management reasons).
The following are potential pros and cons of this approach (Table 4-53).
TABLE 4-53 RUNNING PILOT PROJECTS FOR HYDRAIL
Pros

Cons

Testing of the Hydrail related technology would occur prior
to a program-wide implementation sometime in the future,
which would lessen the risk profile for government

There is likely interface risk between the Hydrail pilot
projects and the rest of the GO network if overhead
electrification is implemented on the rest of the network
This approach may lead to a separation of sections
throughout the GO network, which could lead to
inefficiencies; however, this may be at least partially
mitigated with good planning.

A more natural development of the hydrogen fuel industry
will occur if the pilot project is successful

The scale of pilot projects is smaller and economies of scale
may be impacted on the rest of the network, which may
lead to higher cost delivery of services

Government reduces its risk of the technology not working
and service being significantly interrupted to a confined
section(s) of the network

Innovations, cost savings and other positive features of
Hydrail, should they be realized, will be limited to smaller
sections of the network

The timing of pilot projects can be aligned to the
diminishing useful life of existing diesel locomotives, which
may be proven to be a good value for taxpayer money (i.e.,
not abandoning good quality diesel locomotives
immediately)

Duplication of operators, maintenance providers and
infrastructure to support the entire network will likely result,
as different approaches will be required for Hydrail and
overhead electrification

4.10.7 Timeline Considerations
Many of the outstanding commercial and procurement related aspects of Hydrail will take
considerable amounts of time to address. Although many of these issues can be addressed in parallel,
others require a more sequential approach. For instance, a review and purchase of land to
accommodate hydrogen generation and storage is only possible once it is known where capacity
exists for both electricity on the grid and water for the hydrolysis process.

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

The procurement model and approach to proceed with Hydrail (pilot project on a portion of the
network vs. application for the entire network), should it be deemed to be a good option, is also likely
to impact the timeline of the RER strategy. The current plan for procurement of overhead
electrification of the GO network is:


RFQ – spring 2018 to summer 2018



RFP – summer 2018 to summer 2019



Financial close late 2019

It is unclear if preparations for accommodating Hydrail within this currently planned timeline could be
achieved, especially since various Hydrail implementation/procurement options may still be chosen. If
Hydrail is pursued as separate pilot projects, it more likely that the existing critical path for overhead
electrification could be achieved.
In any case, if Hydrail is to be considered alongside or shortly following the existing overhead
electrification timeline, the following actions should be started in early 2018:


Further clarification and development of the regulatory framework to support Hydrail and the
related supply chain



Continue working with industry (that is, train manufacturers) to better understand what is possible
to facilitate the inclusion of hydrogen powered rolling stock



Continue engaging with potential investors to better understand their willingness to accept risk on
new technology on a major infrastructure project



Develop and implement a labour force strategy to ensure adequate supply of qualified labour to
support Hydrail once it is in operation



Broadening of PSOS to allow for Hydrail (only if it is being allowable as an innovation through the
planned integrated DBFOM procurement)



Develop a supply and demand strategy for electricity and water to support hydrogen production
along or near the GO network corridor



Develop a land acquisition study and follow up implementation strategy to accommodate Hydrail
(that is, bidders are unlikely to want to take the risk of acquiring land to accommodate the
hydrogen production and distribution supply chain when government has expropriation rights)



Ensure that the Hydrail option is aligned (or at least not prevented from being achieved) with
existing Package 1 and 2 design work. This should be done in advance of procurements through
design requirements, similar to how installation of four Overhead Catenary System (OCS) concrete
bases are being installed during station developments to accommodate overhead electrification
of the Go network.

At some point in early 2018, a go/no-go decision needs to be made on how or if Hydrail will be
approached to meet Metrolinx RER Strategy goals. This date may be further into the future if separate
pilot projects are being pursued; however, a decision still needs to be made in early 2018 as to what
the scope of these pilot projects will be because there will be implications for the larger integrated
DBFOM procurement.

Transition Plan

This section describes how the Hydrail System could become operational within the RER program.

4.11.1 Strategy to Introduce Hydrail
A DBFOM RFQ and RFP process is presently being prepared for the RER program. The timeline for
this process is still under review but is presently planned to be launched at the end of Q1-2018, with
the RFP issuance in Q4-2018. Given the significance of this procurement, a contract award for this
scope of work is not anticipated until the end of Q1-2020.
The DBFOM contract is expected to cover the infrastructure modifications required for RER
independently of the rolling stock technology, for example track, signalling, communications, stations.
It will also give the opportunity to the different proponents to propose their preferred electrification
solution; either wired, with the installation of an overhead catenary system, or a wireless alternative
that could be addressed by Hydrail.
As a result, the DBFOM procurement process is likely to be a strong influencing factor in the decision
concerning whether Hydrail is implemented.
Considering the scenario that Hydrail is the preferred electrification solution of the successful DBFOM
proponent, there are several important factors for consideration in determining how Hydrail could be
brought into service:
1. Decisions about where and how the hydrogen is to be produced, and how the HFC-powered rail
vehicles will be refuelled will influence how long it will take to design and implement the required
static infrastructure:


As part of the scope of work that is described in the Next Steps section we are recommending
the further study is undertaken in these areas;



However, the milestones of first vehicle testing, production vehicle testing and commissioning,
and initial service on one corridor could all be achieved using temporary facilities and shortterm supply contracts.

2. The design of a HFC-powered locomotive or EMU will also depend on decisions and progress
relating to the specification and design of the:


RER train service plan



Rail vehicle performance requirements and technical specifications



Signalling system



Train protection system



Rail vehicle stabling and maintenance facilities.

All of these factors are outside the scope of the Hydrail program to assess at this stage in terms of
how they will be undertaken and what milestone dates are achievable.
3. The decision as to which corridor to use to introduce an initial Hydrail service will depend on:


The RER infrastructure upgrade plan and actual progress made against this plan



Which corridor represents the optimum choice in terms of benefits delivery from the enhanced
performance of electric trains.

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

As with point 2, these factors are outside the scope of the Hydrail program to assess at this stage
in terms of how they will be undertaken and what milestone dates are achievable.
In relation to considering the Hydrail System’s ability to transition into service, it is significant to
understand that a Hydrail service can be commenced incrementally once individual rail vehicles are
commissioned and approved for service, and a basic supporting fuelling and maintenance
infrastructure is in place.
This compares to the overhead catenary system where a whole corridor would need to be completed
and commissioned before revenue services could commence.

4.11.2 Timescales
On the assumption that the first set of factors do not impose a constraint on the ability of Hydrail to be
implemented at its preferred pace, and that we can take advantage of an incremental start of service,
the proposed transition plan for Hydrail is outlined in the schedule below (Figure 4-49).
FIGURE 4-49 TRANSITION PLAN SCHEDULE

Some of the key assumptions underlying this proposed transition plan are that:


Key learnings from the HFC Bi-level EMU Concept Design and the HFC Locomotive Concept
Design projects are incorporated into the DBFOM process;



Key learnings from the HFC locomotive detailed design, build and test project are incorporated
into the Hydrail Rail Vehicle Design project and the build and testing of the first Hydrail vehicles;



Key learnings from the Hydrail subsystems concept designs (as defined in the “Recommended
Next Steps” section) are incorporated into the Hydrail Infrastructure Design and Build project;



Other activities particularly those relating to the definition of how railway operations would be
managed for a Hydrail System and how regulatory approval would be achieved are successfully
completed.

On this basis, it is considered feasible that the production of HFC rail vehicles could commence in
2023 and that an initial service on one corridor could commence in mid-2024. If this initial service is
then incrementally enhanced over the course of a year it would then be possible to introduce HFC rail
vehicles into service on the other corridors in accordance with the rate at which they are
manufactured.

Risks and Opportunities

The successful implementation of the Hydrail System would require significant and unique challenges
to be managed. Successfully managing such a large program would be inherently ‘risky’ due to the
uncertainty and complexity associated with integrating hydrogen technologies in a heavy rail context
on such a large scale.
The objective of this section is to explore and evaluate those sources of uncertainty and complexity
which could have an impact on the cost, timing, performance and other benefits of the Hydrail System
and to compare these as an alternative to the planned electrification solution.
Our assessment classifies risks in three categories of when the risk might occur:


System Design Risks – these are risks that could occur during the Hydrail System design phase,



System Implementation Risks – these are risks that could occur during the Hydrail System
implementation phase, and



System Operation Risks – these are risks that could occur during the operation of the Hydrail
System.

The risks have been evaluated in terms of:


Our assessment of the probability of the risk occurring based on our current level of knowledge of
the risk – this is represented as high, medium, or low,



The significance of the impact that the risk would have on achieving the objectives of the Hydrail
Program if this risk occurs – this is represented as high, medium, or low.

The risk assessment also contains our recommendations of the actions that could be taken to mitigate
the probability and/or significance of the risk.
At the same time, we have also identified opportunities for Hydrail to generate benefits in addition to
those assessed in the feasibility study. These Hydrail opportunities are described at the end of the
section.

4.12.1 System Design Risks
4.12.1.1 Regulatory Framework for HFC Rail Vehicles
There might be significant concerns raised by Transport Canada relating to the crashworthiness,
refuelling, maintenance, and degraded service of the hybrid HFC subsystem on rail vehicle.


Type: System Design.



Probability of risk occurring: Medium - There are many codes and standards that will apply to the
design of the fuel cell subsystems. There is also the experience of gaining regulatory approval of
the Alstom train in Germany. However, there is a lack of experience of the use of hydrogen within
Transport Canada and there is the potential for the process of obtaining safety case approval to be
protracted.



Significance: High – If this risk occurs it could add a significant amount of time to the planned
milestones of commencing Hydrail train services.



Mitigation: Proactive engagement with Transport Canada to discuss and develop a
comprehensive safety risk assessment through out all the development stages of Hydrail. Parallel

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

engagement with TSSA and CSA to help demonstrate the existing certification for individual HFC
system components.


Comparative assessment with Electrification: There is less risk to electrification, since electric
locomotives and EMUs operate on many rail systems. The common risk that would apply to both
Hydrail and Electrification is in the use of UIC compliant EMUs on GO, which has traditionally
operated FRA compliant passenger and freight locomotives.

4.12.1.2 Model-related Risks
The development of the Hydrail Operational Simulation Model required making assumptions about
future operations and costs, in addition to assumptions about system operations and train
performance. There is a risk that these assumptions could be significantly too optimistic, resulting in
higher than expected operating costs, more developmental risk, or poorer performance than
anticipated.


Type: System Design



Probability of risk occurring - Low



The development of the Hydrail Operational Simulation Model involved engagement with subject
matter experts in the industry and research institutions and universities. In addition to this, the
components being modelled exist as individual units and are highly scalable. Input and reviews
from multiple parties will have reduced the risk of too optimistic assumptions.



Significance – Medium



While there is uncertainty around some of the assumptions, a thorough sensitivity analysis around
these assumptions has lowered the level of uncertainty. Additionally, contingency percentages are
included in the operational simulation modelling estimates.



Mitigation: It is proposed to carry out further development work on the Operational Simulation
Model as part of the “Recommmended Next Steps” activities defined in Section 6.



Comparative assessment with Electrification: There is a similar risk within the modelling that has
been done for electrification in relation to the forecast capital and operating costs. However, this
should be lower than for the Hydrail System because the scope is better defined and there will be
fewer assumptions.

4.12.1.3 System Integration Complexity of the HFC Rail Vehicles
There is a risk that the design period of the HFC rail vehicles is greater than planned due to
unexpected complexities that emerge in integrating the hybrid HFC subsystem into the existing EMU
and locomotive platforms.


Type: System Design



Probability of Risk Occurring – Medium
The feasibility study report from Hydrogenics on the HFC locomotive has not identified any
significant systems integration risks and we know from the Alstom Coradi iLint, the CRRC Gaoming
project and other one-off rail vehicle projects that this is not an insurmountable problem.
However, we also know that modern rail vehicles are complex machines where equipment needs
to be installed in very confined spaces. Therefore, it would not be surprising if some system
integration challenges are encountered during the design phase which require unplanned scope
of work to resolve.

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT



Significance – Medium
If this risk occurs it could have a consequential impact in the start of the build phase and,
therefore, on the start of revenue services. However, we would be confident that these types of
issues could be resolved through focussed engineering effort which would not have a significant
impact on the development, test and build durations of the HFC rail vehicles.



Mitigation: The current HFC Rail Vehicle Projects, within the Hydrail Program scope, are intended
to be part of the process of mitigating this risk by investigating, at a conceptual level, how a hybrid
HFC subsystem would be integrated into a locomotive and a bi-level EMU platforms. The outputs
of this work are intended to inform the RER rail vehicle systems engineering strategy that will be
adopted by the rail vehicle manufacturer.



Comparative assessment with Electrification: There is no significant risk to electrification, since
electric locomotives and EMUs exist in the market and do not require any additional equipment to
be integrated into them to meet the RER electrification requirements.

4.12.1.4 Operational Range of the HFC Rail Vehicles
There is a risk that the HFC locomotive or the HFC EMU will need to be refueled with hydrogen within
their daily operational hours to be able to operate the planned number of trips in the RER train service
plan.


Type: System Design



Probability of Risk Occurring – Medium
Assumptions have been made in the Operational Simulation model about the space that will be
available on the rail vehicles for the storage of hydrogen. The HFC locomotive and HFC EMU
concept design projects might identify that these assumptions are too optimistic and that the
amount of hydrogen, in gas form, that can be carried should be reduced, which in turn will reduce
the range that the rail vehicle can operate before refuelling.



Significance – Medium
If this risk occurs it would have an impact on the operation of the Hydrail System as it would
require refuelling of the rail vehicles to take place within the operating day. The impact of this on
the proposed RER train service plan and fleet size is unclear; however, it would not be substantially
different from the impact of the refuelling that takes place during the day for the current fleet of
diesel locomotives.



Mitigation: It is planned to mitigate this risk by:
a) setting the rail vehicle manufacturers, working on the concept designs, the objective of
maximising the volume of compressed gas hydrogen that can be accommodated on their
vehicles, without compromising functionality and safety
b) optimising the train service patterns and associated duty cycles that a Hydrail rail service would
operate to minimize the amount of hydrogen that would be needed for an all-day service
without refuelling.



Comparative assessment with Electrification: There is no significant risk to electrification, since
electric locomotives and EMUs do not carry their own fuel on-board and can draw as power as
they need, when they need it, from the overhead catenary system.

4.12.1.5 Performance of the HFC rail vehicles
There is a risk that it might not be possible to design the HFC rail vehicles so that they can operate the
proposed RER train service plan on each corridor.


Type: System Design



Probability of Risk Occurring – Medium
The sizing of the components of the hybrid HFC subsystem for the HFC locomotive and the HFC
EMU has been calculated to meet the acceleration and peak power demands needed to operate
the RER train service plan. This sizing has been undertaken by CNL and has been corroborated
independently by modelling from Hydrogenics as part of their HFC locomotive support services.
However, HFC rail vehicles with the required performance characteristics have not been built
before and therefore there could be unknown risks that emerge during the design phase that
could reduce the forecast performance capability.



Significance – Medium
If this risk occurs it is only likely to reduce the expected performance levels by a relatively small
amount, which in turn should not significantly affect the BCR for the project.



Mitigation: It is planned to mitigate this risk by undertaking more detail calculations, during the
next stage of the project, of the performance of the hybrid HFC subsystem based on a clearer
definition of the required duty cycles for each corridor.
We will also consider the opportunity (described below) of designing the hybrid HFC subsystem
with a slightly reduced performance objective to determine the impact that this would have on
system capital and operating cost compared to the resulting reduction in RER benefits.



Comparative assessment with Electrification: There is no significant risk to electrification, since the
train service plan for RER has been designed to be achievable using currently available electric
locomotives and BL EMUs.

4.12.1.6 Environmental Assessments
The Hydrail System will require Environmental Assessments to be undertaken for the hydrogen
production facilities. There is a risk that this process will take longer than planned, creating challenges
in achieving the committed dates for RER service.


Type: System Design



Probability of Risk Occurring: Medium - The likelihood that this risk will occur is currently Medium
as there has not yet been any engagement with the planning authorities.



Significance: Medium - If environmental compliance and approvals are not achieved by about
2022 it would have an impact on the commencement of construction of these facilities.



Mitigation: Proactive engagement will be required with the MOECC, local conservation
authorities, and municipal and provincial governments to begin the Environmental Approval
process.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: Environmental assessments for the Electrification
work is underway and engagement has already commenced with local authorities to meet RER
dates. However, there could be objections raised from local residents to the network in relation to
construction noise, vegetation removal and visual intrusion.

4.12.1.7 Infrastructure Required for Hydrail
The electrolyzer, storage and refuelling subsystems will need to be designed to allow for efficient
operations of the Hydrail network. The detailed design of this infrastructure needs further
investigation and there is a risk that a fundamental scope or process issue will be discovered during
this work that will have a significant impact on the expected efficiency and cost of operation.


Type: System Design



Probability of Risk Occurring: Low - The Hydrail System uses standard off-the-shelf
componentswhose performance characteristics are proven.



Significance: High - The impact of this risk is significant as it could have a significant impact on the
functional and economic viability of Hydrail.



Mitigation: It is intended to mitigate this risk by undertaking concept designs of these subsystems
as described in the “Recommended Next Steps” section.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: This is a low risk for electrification. Overhead wires
and signalling immunization will need to be installed. The risk is mitigated by the know-how that
exists in the industry.

4.12.1.8 Technological Development of Hydrail
Since a Hydrail System has not yet been implemented at the scale RER requires, there could be
challenges related to the scaling of the HFC subsystems, and potential performance limitations due
challenges in systems integration.


Type: System Design



Probability of Risk Occurring: Low - This is mainly a systems integration risk that will be
approached through engineering design with major equipment manufacturers. The risk that scale
effects could have a significant detrimental impact is low as the components are modular.



Significance: Medium - If system integration issues do occur, particularly with the rail vehicles and
the refuelling facility it could delay the start of implementation or reduce the performance of the
Hydrail System below expected levels.



Mitigation: The development of the concept designs and subsequent prototypes will allow a
detailed analysis of the system integration and scalability. Engagement with major industry
manufacturers and universities to test concepts in their testing facilities will help evolve the design
to the requisite levels of performance and reliability.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: There is a lower risk to electrification, since OCS
equipment and electric rail vehicles use technology that have a high level of component
development and systems integration. Locomotives and EMUs are certified and exist in the
market.

4.12.1.9 Private Sector Risk Assessment of Hydrail
It is currently intended that the Hydrail System is included in the RER DBFOM procurement scope.
Due to the unfamiliarity that many proponents will have with hydrogen and the Hydrail System they
could consider it to contain a high level of risk, resulting in them applying a significant cost premium
to it for the development, operation and maintenance of the system.


Type: System Design



Probability of Risk Occurring: Medium - The likelihood that this risk occurs will be driven by how
the risk profile of Hydrail is seen to compare to that of Electrification, and how the risk transfer
mechanisms are defined in the DBFOM contract.



Significance: High - There is a high level of significance related to this risk as it will be a
fundamental driver as to whether the Hydrail System is preferred to Electrification.



Mitigation: It is intended to mitigate this risk by undertaking further development work on the
definition and design of the Hydrail System across several areas, including: subsystems concept
designs, hydrogen production locations, railway operations, capital and operating costs, transition
plan, and codes and standards. The scope of this work is outlined in the Recommended Next
Steps section.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: Potential proponents might also see a high level of
risk associated with Electrification in relation to the: capital cost of implementation, operating cost,
and transfer of risks such as utilities diversions and operational disruption.

4.12.1.10 Implications to RER Scope of Work due to Hydrail
There is a risk that the functional requirements of the Hydrail System might require significant
additional infrastructure within the scope of work of RER.


Type: System Design



Probability of Risk Occurring: Low - The feasibility study has not identified areas of the operation of
the Hydrail System that are likely to have a significant impact on the scope of the RER
infrastructure. The area that this risk is most relevant to is the design of the stabling yards in
relation to the: design of the refuelling storage and dispensing facilities, and design of station
platforms for the operation of 12 carriage consists with 12 locomotives.



Significance: Medium - The objective of the refuelling system for Hydrail is to replicate the
operational functionality of refuelling the current diesel fleet. However, the implications of
refuelling a much larger fleet of trains than currently exists will make this process more
complicated than at present.



Mitigation: A thorough study with Metrolinx Planning and Policy, and Fleet Operations will need to
be conducted to better understand the RER service plan approach. Following this, a technical
analysis will be conducted with Fleet Engineering to understand the impact of HFC locomotives
and EMUs to achieve the RER level of service.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: The scope of RER is currently being designed to
meet the functional requirements of Electrification. The likelihood of additional infrastructure work
needing to be undertaken within the scope of the Electrification program will relate to risks such
as unexpected utilities diversions and existing infrastructure modifications.

4.12.1.11 Impact on Hydrail Scope of Work due to RER
There is a risk that the RER scope of work could have a negative impact on Hydrail.


Type: System Design



Probability of Risk Occurring: Medium - The definition of the RER scope of infrastructure and train
services is still evolving and therefore it is likely that changes from the current definition will have
an impact on Hydrail.



Significance: Medium - There may be constraints of the feasible locations for the hydrogen
production and refuelling facilities. Additionally, train service patterns may affect the required
performance characteristics and range of the HFC rail vehicles.



Mitigation: As part of the proposed “Recommended Next Steps” it will be important for the Hydrail
team to continue to work closely with the RER Program team to understand evolutions in the RER
infrastructure scope, fleet strategy and timetable.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: There is no impact on electrification

4.12.1.12 New Emerging Technology by 2025
Technology developments in propulsion systems could create a feasible lower cost alternative to
Hydrail. Continuing innovations in the rail industry could usurp the Hydrail option. As an example,
battery-only trains are also being tested in various parts of the world. With the significant level of
funding and research into battery technology from major automotive companies, a breakthrough in
that sector is possible.


Type: System Design



Probability of Risk Occurring: Low - It has been suggested that battery-only trains could be a viable
alternative to Hydrail. However, there are fundamental issues with the power to weight ratios of
battery systems that mean they are unlikely to be an appropriate solution for a heavy demand
commuter network like GO. In addition, the research improvements in battery technologies that
are frequently publicized are unlikely to be commercially available within the time frames required
by RER.



Significance: Low - Although battery only technology might become a viable propulsion system
for rail vehicles in the future this is likely to be limited to light rail vehicles.



Mitigation: The Hydrail team will continue to monitor industry and technology trends to assess
whether the likelihood of occurrence of this risk changes.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: The same risk applies to electrification.

Table 4-54 collates the risks identified above and orders them using a rough risk ranking score of
Probability multiplied by Significance, based on High = 3, Medium = 2 and Low = 1.

4.12.2 System Implementation Risks
4.12.2.1 Public Perception of Hydrogen
Misconceptions by the public about the safety risk ofhydrogen might cause commuters and local
neighbourhoods to resist the implementation of Hydrail.


Type: System Implementation



Probability of Risk Occurring: Medium – This is based on current perceptions of hydrogen.
However, a focused public relations effort should be able to mitigate this risk.



Significance: Medium – Negative perceptions of safety risks could adversely impact on the location
of hydrogen production and storage facilites and GO ridership levels.



Mitigation: Engage with Metrolinx public relations and communications teams to overcome these
prejudices, using a comprehensive public engagement strategy.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: Electrification does not have this same risk.

4.12.2.2 Uncertainty Regarding Rate at which HFC Rail Vehicles can be
Introduced into Revenue Service
There is a risk that the duration between the DBFOM contract award and the planned start of the
enhanced RER services is insufficient to fully develop, test and deliver the required HFC rail vehicles.


Type: System Implementation



Probability of Risk Occurring: Medium - Since HFC technology of the scale required for Hydrail has
not previously been integrated into a rail vehicle this risk relates to system integration, train control
and safety regulation issues that might emerge as the rail vehicles are designed and tested.



Significance: High - This risk has high significance because the key objective of the RER Program is
to introduce enhanced rail services on the GO network from 2025.

CPG-PGM-RPT-245
DATE: 02/02/2018

251

Revision B

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT



Mitigation: Metrolinx has already initiated the two HFC rail vehicle projects to mitigate this risk.
The HFC Bi-level EMU Concept Design Project has the objective of obtaining assurance that a
hybrid HFC system can be integrated into manufacturers existing EMU products. The HFC
Locomotive Concept Design Project has a similar objective and in addition will further progress
the systems integration development by proceeding with preliminary and detailed designs. It is
intended that this work is completed during the DBFOM procurement process so that bidders can
confidently plan for the production design and delivery of an HFC rail vehicle fleet within the
required RER timescales.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: The equivalent uncertainty in relation to the
Electrification Program relates to the timescales for completing the electrification infrastructure on
each GO corridor. If significant risks emerge in relation to corridor access, utilities diversions and
infrastructure modifications then this could also delay the achievement of the 2025 target.

4.12.2.3 Ability of Market to Provide Equipment and Design Services
There is a risk that hydrogen technology component vendors will have trouble scaling up to supply
the quantity of hydrogen infrastructure required by the Hydrail System.


Type: System Implementation



Probability of Risk Occurring: Medium - Even though individual vendors will be able to anticipate
that Hydrail is likely to procure a considerable volume of components they may not be able to
scale-up within the time required by RER. However, the whole hydrogen market is expanding in
parallel to the development of Hydrail so the risk is likely to be reduced.



Significance: Medium - A delay in the initial supply of key subsystem components would lead to a
delay in the commencement of services and slow down the incremental roll-out.



Mitigation: Proactive engagement with the market and provincial government to share the
ongoing development efforts. This will provide the hydrogen market with expectations, allowing
them to ramp up on their ability to deliver services.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: Electrification components are commoditized, and
since there are major players with electric locomotives and EMUs which are certified and exist in
the market, there are fewer uncertainties about the ability of the market to provide equipment and
services related to electrification.

4.12.2.4 Zoning and Planning
There might be objections raised by planning authorities and local communities to proposed
locations for the hydrogen production facilities.


Type: System Implementation



Probability of Risk Occurring: Medium - The likelihood of this risk occurring will depend on the
number of location options that are available and the success of the preceding public
communication strategy.



Significance: Medium - If there are delays in obtaining planning consents it would still be possible
to commence an initial Hydrail service through the purchase of hydrogen from existing industrial
suppliers.



Mitigation: Proactive engagement will be required with the municipal and provincial governments
to begin the planning work and obtain the zoning approvals required to set up the support
infrastructure for Hydrail.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: Electrification also has planning consent risks in
relation to the siting of substations.

Table 4-55 collates the risks identified above and orders them using a rough risk ranking score of
Probability multiplied by Significance, based on High = 3, Medium = 2 and Low = 1.

4.12.3 System Operational Risks
4.12.3.1 Forecasting the Future Price of Electricity
The actual average price differential between peak and off-peak rates might change from the forecast
rates provided by IESO.


Type: System Operational



Probability of Risk Occurring: Medium - The electricity price forecasts used to calculate the
operating costs of Hydrail and Electrification have been provided by IESO and are based on the
2017 Long Term Energy Plan for Ontario



Significance: High – If the differencebetween the price of electricity paid by Hydrail and that for
Electrification narrows, this would weaken the economic case for Hydrail.



Mitigation: Engage with the provincial government to define, or pre-establish, the cost of
electricity relating to Hydrail.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: If the difference between the price of electricity paid
by Hydrail and that for Electrification increases, this would weaken the economic case for
Electrification.

4.12.3.2 Hydrail Operational Complexity
There are uncertainties about how HFC rail vehicles will be brought into service at the start of each
day and refuelled at the end of each day. There are also uncertainties around the type and frequency
of maintenance and renewal operations of the HFC components. These could have a significant
negative impact on the expected operational efficiency of the RER level of service.

253

Revision B

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT



Type: System Operational



Probability of Risk Occurring: Medium - The probability of there being a significant negative
impact on the RER level of service from the adoption of HFC rail vehicles is not considered to be
high as Metrolinx currently has experience of managing a fleet of rail vehicles that requires
refuelling every day and that requires in-house maintenance activities to be carried out on the
vehicles’ propulsion systems.



Significance: High - This is a risk that is important because one of the key factors in determining
the viability of the Hydrail System is ensuring that it has a high level of operational efficiency



Mitigation: As part of the proposed “Recommended Next Steps” activities it is intended to
undertake further analysis of the operational capabilities of the Hydrail System and how they align
with the RER level of service.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: This is a much lower risk for the Electrification
Program as electric locomotives and EMUs have well proven operational and maintenance
requirements. In addition, the electric rail vehicles do not require to be refuelled.

4.12.3.3 Maintenance Staff Capabilities
It might be difficult to find sufficient numbers of staff with the specialized skills to maintain the Hydrail
System components, both on the locomotive and at offsite facilities.


Type: System Operational



Probability of Risk Occurring: Low - The likelihood of this risk occurring is low because there is
sufficient time to mitigate it and the demand for skilled hydrogen technicans will follow the
incremental introduction of an HFC fleet.



Significance: Medium - The impact of this risk will be on train service performance.



Mitigation: Engage with Ontario Ministry of Advanced Education and colleges in Ontario to ensure
that courses are available to train and certify existing and new staff as hydrogen technicians.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: Electrification will have a similar risk, since the new
electric locomotives and EMUs will require maintenance staff with new skills.

4.12.3.4 Hydrogen Production Failure
There is a risk of a shortage of supply of hydrogen due to a failure in the hydrogen production
subsystem or in the supply of electricity from the grid.


Type: System Operational



Probability of Risk Occurring: Low - The probability of this occurring is low as it is intended to store
up to three days supply of hydrogen at each hydrogen production facility. If this is not sufficient at
one particular location, contingency plans will be put in place to transport hydrogen from one of
the other production facilities.



Significance: Medium - This is not a significant risk as there will be built-in supply buffers in the
system to limit the severity of the impact.



Mitigation: As part of the proposed “Recommended Next Steps” activities it is intended to
produce a concept design of a generic hydrogen production facility. Within the design process
consideration will be given to mitigating this risk to an acceptable level.

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: There is an equivalent risk in the Electrification
Program which relates to the reliability of supply of electricity. Redundancy has been built into the
connection of the OCS with the electricity grid to reduce this risk to an acceptable level.

4.12.3.5 Reliability of HFC Trains
There is a risk that the availability and performance of the HFC rail vehicles could be compromised
due to failures of components in the rail vehicle subsystem.


Type: System Operational



Probability of Risk Occurring: Medium - A rail vehicle is a harsh environment particularly due to
climatic conditions and vibration. However, there is a considerable amount of experience of
operating HFC-powered buses where these conditions are probably worse than on a rail network.
In addition, the HFC subsystem will be designed so that the failure of one component will not have
a catastrophic impact on the operation of the rail vehicle. For example: the fuel cells will be
arranged in parallel stacks so that a failure of one unit will only result in a reduced amount of
output power and not the shut down of the complete fuel cell subsystem; even if the whole fuel
cell subsystem becomes unavailable there will be sufficient power in the battery system to enable
the rail vehicle to operate in degraded mode so that it can reach a place of safety; the battery
subsystem will also be designed so that a failure in one battery will only lead to a reduction in peak
power available to accelerate the train. It is likely that in this scenario that it will be possible to
continue to operate the train at close to normal performance. Furthermore, the planned train
consists will have the following redundancies: EMUs have multiple powered coaches so that the
train should be able to continue to operate even if the system on coach fails; adopting a two
locomotive consist for 12 carriages means that even if one locomotive fails it will still be possible
for the consist to continue working.



Significance: High - This is a risk of significant importance because it is fundamental to the
operational viability of the Hydrail System.



Mitigation: Gaining assurance about how the HFC rail vehicles will be able to continue to function
is one of the factors that will be investigated as part of the HFC Bi-level Concept Design project
and the HFC Locomotive project.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: There are similar risks with the electric locomotives
and EMUs. Even though there is a highlevel of reliability of the electrical components on an
electric locomotive or an EMU, there is a lower level of sytem redundancy than with a HFC rail
vehicle. In addition, any failure of the overhead contact wire on a section of corridor would lead to
significant operational disruption.

4.12.3.6 Impact on Passengers of a Train Accident
In the event of a train accident there is the potential that passengers could be hurt due to the ignition
or explosion of leaking hydrogen.


Type: System Operational



Probability of Risk Occurring: Low - The likelihood of this is low because: when hydrogen escapes
it disperses into the atmosphere very quickly; if a hydrogen leak does ignite then it burns with a
flame rather than explodes; the hydrogen will be stored on the rail vehicles in multiple tanks so
that it is unlikely that more than one tank would be damaged in an accident; the hydrogen will be
stored at 700 bar in the storage tanks which will encourage the hydrogen to escape quickly; in the
case of the HFC EMU the hydrogen tanks will be installed near the roof of the train where the gas

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

can quickly escape in the event of tank rupture; in the case of the HFC locomotive the tanks will be
isolated from the adjacent passenger coach by a fire proof barrier; the rail vehicle subsystem will
be designed to achieve a high level of crashworthiness; the rail vehicle subsystem will be
designed with automated shut-off systems that are designed to limit the amount of hydrogen that
can escape.


Significance: High - Any risk relating to safety will be treated with the highest level of significance
during the design of the HFC rail vehicles.



Mitigation: Gaining assurance about how the HFC subsystem will respond to an accident will be
part of the activities that we propose to undertake in Q1 and Q2 2018. It will also feature as part of
the HFC Bi-level Concept Design project and the HFC Locomotive project.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: In the event of an electric rail vehicle accident, there
could be a risk to passengers due to damaged overhead catenary infrastructure.

4.12.3.7 Implications to RER due to Hydrail
There is a risk that the operation of the Hydrail System might have a negative impact on the ability to
achieve the planned RER level of service.


Type: System Operational



Probability of Risk Occurring: Low - The feasibility study has not identified any area of the
operation of the Hydrail System that is likely to have a significant impact on the operation of RER.
The areas that this risk is most relevant to are: the performance and operation of a two-locomotive
consist; and the refuelling process.



Significance: Medium - The objective of the design of the Hydrail System is to match the RER level
of service in terms of terms of the RER train service plan. If this risk occurs it seems likely that the
reduction in level of service will be small. This risk also generates an opportunity whereby a small
reduction in train performance could lead to a significant reduction in Hydrail’s operating cost.



Mitigation: As part of the proposed “Recommended Next Steps” activities it is intended that the
Hydrail team will develop a more refined assessment of the train service capability of the HFC rail
vehicles and the operating processes of refuelling. We will also work with the RER Program team
to model operating cost savings that could be achieved from a range of reductions in train
performance and how this might impact the BCR for the Hydrail System.



Comparative Assessment with Electrification: This exact risk is unlikely to be experienced with
electrification as electric locomotives and EMUs that are available for the major rail vehicle
manufacturers have performance characteristics that have been used in the simulation modelling
of RER. However, there might be the reverse risk if rail vehicles supplied have more performance
characteristics than required for RER (acceleration, top speed).

Table 4-56 collates the risks identified above and orders them using a rough risk ranking score of
Probability multiplied by Significance, based on High = 3, Medium = 2 and Low = 1.
The risks that have a score from 6 to 3 are of sufficient importance that their further investigation is
included within the scope of activities outlined in the “Recommended Next Steps” section.

4.12.4 Opportunities
4.12.4.1 Incremental Service Introduction
Electrification requires the infrastructure on each corridor to be completed before electrified services
can commence.
With the Hydrail System an electrified service can be introduced incrementally starting from a single
HFC rail vehicle on a corridor and then building up to a full service over a period of time.
The benefits of this approach are:


The possible earlier introduction of electrified services on any corridor than would be the case
with electrification which would improve the revenue benefits profile for RER;



Because there is less up-front fixed CAPEX for the Hydrail System compared to Electrification the
NPV for Hydrail is more aligned to the profile of the rolling stock delivery, whereas the NPV for
Electrification is more aligned to the up-front CAPEX. This should create a comparative advantage
for the Hydrail System in the business case analysis.



Most of the capital cost for Hydrail System is related to manufacture of the rolling stock and
therefore this is spread over the production period a longer period over which the capital cost of a
reduced dependency between the completion of RER infrastructure and the introduction of
electric rolling stock onto the GO network which could be beneficial in terms of public relations.

4.12.4.2 Advantage of Using Surplus Electricity
The Hydrail System will generally use surplus baseload electricity generated in the province to
produce hydrogen and will therefore pay for its power using rates that will not include the GA factor.
The OCS electrification option will largely use the higher day time rates of electricity that will also
include the GA.
Because the Hydrail System will use about 15 percent of the surplus power that is generated it
potentially could have an impact on the size of the GA that is added to the bills of all Ontario power
users.

4.12.4.3 Remove Diesel Locomotive Services from the Milton and
Richmond Hill Corridors
The rail infrastructure of the Milton and Richmond Hill corridors are not owned by Metrolinx. As a
result, it is not possible to install overhead electrification infrastructure on these corridors. However,
the Hydrail System option provides the ability to operate electric train services on these two corridors.
The benefits of this would be improved RER services being operated on these corridors and a
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for the GO network compared to electrification.
However, there would be additional capital and operating costs for the Hydrail System which would
need to be assessed against the revenue benefits of providing RER services on these corridors.

4.12.4.4 Hydrail as a Catalyst for the Implementation of a ‘Hydrogen Economy’
in Ontario
One of the constraints to the broader adoption of hydrogen as a replacement to fossil fuels as an
energy carrier is the current limited availability of hydrogen outside of industrial applications.
An investment in the infrastructure of hydrogen production and storage could be used as a lever by
the government of Ontario and/or the private sector to make hydrogen available to users outside of
Metrolinx.
There is the opportunity for Metrolinx to work with a broad cross-section of government departments
to develop a strategy similar to that recently published by the South Australia government203 for a
roadmap for a broader use of hydrogen across Ontario.
The potential benefits of this are:


Sharing of the costs of the fixed infrastructure assets



Reductions in the use of fossil fuels as energy sources



Development of businesses and jobs with a hydrogen technology focus



The development of Ontario as a global leader in the implementation of hydrogen technologies



Adoption of hydrogen as an energy storage material in combination with renewable energy
sources and the associated benefits in relation to the stabilization of the electricity grid in response
to variations in demand.

4.12.4.5 Shared Cost of Fixed Infrastructure
Hydrogen could also have other applications within Metrolinx that could then use the same hydrogen
production infrastructure.
Metrolinx is already considering the use of HFC-powered buses as replacements for its diesel bus
fleet.
There is the potential integrate this strategy with the development of the Hydrail System which could
lead to a shared hydrogen production, storage and refuelling infrastructure.

In addition, there is the potential to use HFCs as main power sources or back-up power sources for
Metrolinx’s property portfolio. This could potentially lead to a reduction in operating costs or at least
improved energy security.

4.12.4.6 Capture of Energy through Regenerative Braking
All modern electric rail vehicles use their traction motors, working in reverse, as part of the vehicle’s
braking system. This means that the traction motor is working as a generator. Regenerative braking is
the ability to capture this electrical energy for a beneficial use.
With rail vehicles operating in an overhead catenary system this energy is fed back into the grid via
the vehicle’s pantograph. The amount of energy that is captured in this way is relatively small
compared to the total potential energy that would be available because there is no resulting benefit
to the operating of the vehicle and so vehicle’s electrical systems are not optimized for this purpose.
With the Hydrail System we believe that there is an opportunity to capture a significant additional
amount of the rail vehicle’s braking energy and to feed it into the batteries and utltracapacitors that
are part of the hybrid HFC subsystem.
We would do this by specifically focusing on the design of the rail vehicle’s electrical systems
(batteries, utltracapacitors and fuel cell) to optimize the amount of energy that can be cost effectively
captured (that is, within the constraints of space availability and equipment cost).
By doing this it should be possible to optimize the design of the subsystem to minimize the volume of
hydrogen that will be consumed on each trip. In this way, it should be possible to increase the overall
range of the Hydrail rail vehicles from what we can be maximized and the minimize the amount of
hydrogen that needs to be produced for the overall Hydrail System.
We plan to investigate this opportunity as part of the HFC Bi-Level EMU and HFC Locomotive projects
that will be undertaken during Q1 and Q2 2018.

RER Program Electrification

This section describes the scope of the currently proposed by the RER Program, including the
proposal for overhead electrification, and the issues that need to be resolved during preliminary
design and implementation.

5.1

Current RER Program

5.1.1

Scope

The Regional Transportation Plan for the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA), or The Big
Move, identifies the need for a significant increase in rail service across the GO network. Accordingly,
the RER program is being planned to provide more frequent, faster, and higher-capacity service204.
In January 2010, a study of the electrification of the GO rail system was initiated as a future alternative
to diesel trains currently in service. The objective of the Electrification Study was to provide
information so that a decision about how GO trains will be powered in the future – using electricity,
enhanced diesel technology, or other means – can be made, as this fleet propulsion upgrade has a
key role in delivering the Big Move205.
The IBC was published in 2015 and scoped the RER program by defining, analyzing, and reporting
the feasibility of various scenarios for GO RER service and infrastructure206.
In the RER business case, Scenario 1 (Do Minimum) is the base case that assumes a continuation of
today’s peak-focussed service patterns and diesel technology. All other scenarios are compared to it.
Scenario 2 (Two-Way All-Day) and Scenario 3 (10-Year Plan) consider more frequent all-day service,
looking at the costs and benefits of all-diesel and some limited electrification. Scenario 4 (Full Build) is
a maximum-build scenario, with frequent all-day service and overhead electrification on all corridors.
These four scenarios were studied so that different levels of service (LOSs) and infrastructure could be
assessed and compared to understand if and how they would achieve strategic objectives, how much
they would cost to build and operate, and how effective they would be at generating benefits, all
while considering deliverability constraints.
Scenario 5 (10-Year Plan Optimized) was then developed based on available funds and a 10-year
build period for delivery (Figure 5-1). This program includes electrification and frequent service on
most inner corridors207. For the purposes of this feasibility report, Hydrail is assessed against RER
Scenario 5.

To sum up, by 2024, the GO rail network is planned to:


Be expanded to enable electrified train service in core system areas at 15-minute frequencies or
better



Offer up to four times the current number of train trips during off-peak hours



Offer twice the current number of trips during peak hours throughout the network208

The scope of the RER project, as described in Scenario 5, involves electrification of the following GO
rail corridors:
1. Union Station Rail Corridor (Figure 5-2) – From Union Pearson (UP) Express Union Station to
Don Yard Layover
2. Lakeshore West Corridor – From just west of Bathurst Street (Mile 1.20) to Burlington
3. Kitchener Corridor – From UP Express Spur 8 (at Highway 427) to Bramalea
4. Barrie Corridor – From Parkdale Junction (off Kitchener Corridor) to Allandale GO Station
5. Stouffville Corridor – From Scarborough Junction (off Lakeshore East Corridor) to Lincolnville GO
6. Station
7. Lakeshore East Corridor – From Don Yard Layover to Oshawa GO Station209
Electrification of the system is one of the components of the RER program. It is being undertaken in
parallel with other projects to build all infrastructure needed to increase service210.
The infrastructure must accommodate the busiest hour of service during the peak-hour period, as well
as any track occupancy required by other rail operators (freight and intercity services). During the
peak hours, the number of trains may vary slightly; therefore, the worst-case scenario, or high peak
hour, was used to develop the infrastructure requirements for the 10-year plan (Scenario 5)211.

Figure 5-1 gives us an idea of the breadth of the civil works required to implement the electrification
infrastructure. Further to the overhead catenary system itself, there are signal immunization services to
be implemented, traction power stations to be built, modifications that need to be made to existing
stations, and changes required for existing bridges and layover facilities.

5.1.2

Train Service Plan

All-day EMU services would operate every 15 minutes to Aldershot, Bramalea, Aurora, Unionville, and
Oshawa; with hourly services to Hamilton (diesel, express Oakville-Union), Barrie (EMU, express
Aurora-Union), and Mount Joy (EMU, as an extension of one in four Unionville trains). Milton and
Richmond Hill would remain peak-only diesel corridors214.
Table 5-1 provides a summary of the Scenario 5 train service plan, by corridor. Figure 5-3 shows the peak
periods, while Figure 5-4 shows off-peak periods.

Procurement of Rolling Stock

Passenger rail rolling stock is traditionally built in fleets customized for a specific application. This is
because, although there are standard technical platforms, railways differ sufficiently in local technical
and environmental requirements. In comparison with automobile or even aircraft manufacture,
production runs are considered small218.
In Scenario 5, approximately 140 EMU cars would be required for the Lakeshore route, and
approximately 30 cars for each additional electrified route.
Procurement of a new rolling stock fleet is assumed to take 4 to 8 years, although it may be possible
to reduce this timeframe. The process entails:


Development of the customer requirements (car size, configuration of doors, seats)



Definition of detailed technical requirements



Definition of procurement contracting structure and finance



Option of long-term maintenance contract with extended warranty

development of the Hydrail System, in relation to the broader questions that inter-relate with the
Provincial government, and in relation to the development of the RER DBFOM.

6.1

Actions to Further Develop Hydrail

The proposed next steps for the development of the Hydrail System are focussed on the need to
maintain alignment between the development of Hydrail and the preparation activities for the RER
DBFOM procurement.
The primary objective of the proposed next steps is to enable the design of the whole Hydrail System
to be taken forward to conceptual design level so that by the time the DBFOM bidders start to
prepare their bids they will have access to high quality information about the design and operation of
the Hydrail System. This will enable the DBFOM bidders to more accurately assess the risks and
benefits of Hydrail in comparison with electrification than would otherwise be the case.
In particular, it is proposed that further work is undertaken in those areas of the Hydrail System where
the DBFOM bidders are likely to want a greater level of certainty than currently exists, at the
completion of the feasibility study. These are:


Refine the Hydrail System design in terms of system size, based on a more accurate representation
of the system configuration in the Operational Simulation model;



Comission concept designs for a HFC EMU, a HFC Locomotive and the hydrogen production,
hydrogen storage and hydrogen fuelling subsystems;



Identify preferred options for location of hydrogen production facilities for each corridor;



Confirm how the Hydrail System would function as an operational railway, particularly in areas
such as maintenance and refuelling;



Confirm the capital and operating cost estimates of the whole Hydrail System based on further
engagement with component vendors and a more formal approach to estimating infrastructure
and vehicle delivery costs;



Confirm how the Hydrail System could be implemented through its development and build
phases and particularly the transition plan of Hydrail into revenue service across the GO network;



Develop a Safety Case roadmap for Hydrail based on consultation with Transport Canada and
organizations responsible for maintaining and developing hydrogen related safety standards;



Build and operate a small-scale prototype of the Hydrail System including an HFC Locomotive.

6.1.1

System Size

The definition of the Hydrail System presented in this feasibility study is based on modelling work that
simulates how the whole system will operate every day. The Operational Simulation Model has been
specifically designed to simulate the performance of each of Hydrail’s subsystems and the design is
based on the following principles:


The fleet mix and train service pattern defined as Scenario 5 of the IBC for RER has been used to
calculate the peak and average power requirements for train trips on each GO corridor;



This data is used to size (power and physical dimensions) the fuel cell and batteries on the rail
vehicles;



This in turn determines how much hydrogen is required to operate the train for each trip, which
enables the total volume of hydrogen that is needed each day to be calculated;



From this the size of the electrolyzer components has been calculated, and



From this the amount of electrical power required each day for the Hydrail System has been
calculated.

At each step in this process, assumptions have been made about the:


RER GO network infrastructure and train services from 2025 onwards, and



Functional performance of each of the components in the Hydrail subsystems

It has been necessary to make these assumptions because:


The scope of RER has been developing in parallel to the Hydrail feasibility study, and



Our access to data on forecast component functional performance has been based on estimates
from a limited number of industry sources.

It is considered by the Hydrail team that many of the assumptions in the model are quite conservative
and therefore it is the team’s view that it would be beneficial to undertake further work to improve the
accuracy of the model’s outputs.
We intend to do this by:


Improving the sophistication of the model’s algorithms to more accurately simulate the power
requirements of the rail vehicles;



Cross-referencing the algorithms in the model with those being used by the rail vehicle
manufacturers who are participating in the HFC Bi-Level EMU Concept Design and HFC
Locomotive Concept Design projects, and



Obtaining access to actual component performance data from a range of manufacturers.

6.1.2

Subsystem Concept Designs

Even though the feasibility study concludes that there are no technology-related flaws with Hydrail
and that all elements required to assemble this system already exist elsewhere in similar applications,
the scale of Hydrail is bigger than anything that has currently been implemented. As a consequence,
there are technical areas of the Hydrail System definition where the levels of uncertainty need to be
reduced so that the risk profile of these areas is comparable to those of the overhead catenary system
solution.
By undertaking subsystem concept designs a much more precise sizing of all the components of the
overall Hydrail System will be achieved. For example, it would enable us to demonstrate how the
expected fuelling time can be achieved and to assess the way in which a Hydrail network could be
operated and maintained.
This reduces these risks so that the DBFOM bidders will be better able to assess the risks and benefits
of Hydrail in comparison with electrification.

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

Therefore, we intend to initiate engineering concept design studies of:
1. A HFC bi-Level EMU. A procurement process is already underway to commission a number of rail
vehicle manufacturers to produce concept designs that integrates a hybrid fuel cell system into
their existing bi-level EMU models. The output of this work will provide valuable information on
whether the performance of the HFC bi-level EMU will meet the RER requirements, the range of
the vehicle between refueling, the likely unit price of the vehicle and the phases in the
development of production models;
2. A HFC Locomotive. A procurement process has started to commission a number of rail vehicle
manufacturers to produce concept designs that integrates a hybrid fuel cell system into their
existing electric locomotive models. The output of this work will provide the same range of useful
information as for the HFC bi-level EMU;
3. A hydrogen production and storage facility of a size that would be needed for one of the GO
corridors. This will provide us with equipment layout information and component sizing and an
understanding of how the facility will be connected to the electricity grid;
4. A hydrogen refuelling and dispensing facility of a size that would be needed to refuel an HFC EMU
fleet and an HFC locomotive fleet. This will also provide us with equipment layout information and
component sizing and an understanding of how the facility will operate in its interface with the rail
vehicles. In particular, it would be designed to achieve the objective of a refuelling time that meets
the fleet operation and maintenance expectations of Metrolinx.
We intend to undertake this work by assembling a team of consultants, government agencies and
universities that we have already engaged with during the feasibility study who have specialist
knowledge and capabilities in these areas. This work wouldbe project managed by the existing
Metrolinx Hydrail team.

6.1.3

Hydrogen Production Location Identification

One of the key variables in the configuration of the Hydrail System are the proposed locations for the
hydrogen production facilities. The factors that will need to be considered in deciding on these
locations include:


The area required for the facility (this has been covered by the work described above)



The locations for rail vehicle stabling facilities in the RER program



Land that is currently available within Metrolinx’s ownership that could be suitable for such a
facility



Land that is outside Metrolinx’s ownership but is close to the proposed rail vehicle stabling
facilities



Land that is suitable for such a facility that is located at some distance from the rail network and
would be suitable to enable transportation of hydrogen by truck or pipeline to the rail network



The potential to expand the facility for hydrogen production use beyond that required for
Metrolinx’s Hydrail



The planning and permitting constraints that would relate to any identified land



The cost of purchase and/or remediation of any identified land

We intend to undertake work that will identify a range of options for the hydrogen production
locations to enable the Hydrail system to function in both its Scenario 5 and full network

configurations. We will then assess these options using the criteria of capital cost, operating cost and
planning feasibility and determine the optimized solution.
The team undertaking this work will include Metrolinx property staff and RER fleet maintenance
planning staff.

6.1.4

Operational Functionality

Although the feasibility study has not identified any flaws in how GO would operate using a Hydrail
System, there are operational processes that need to be considered in more detail to give DBFOM
bidders sufficient assurance that it is feasible to operate. These processes include:


Cyclical maintenance and renewal regimes for the rail vehicle subsystem



Refuelling the trains as part of the end of day processes



Management of degraded rail vehicle operability due to failure of a component within the hybrid
HFC subsystem



Response to degraded rail services that prevents access to a refuelling facility



Start of day and end of day routines for the rail vehicle subsystem



Operational and maintenance routines for the hydrogen production, storage and transportation
subsystems

We intend to create system diagrams for each of these processes so that it is clear how a Hydrail
System would integrate with the railway operational processes that DBFOM bidders will be familiar
with from operating railway systems based on overhead catenary system of electrification.

6.1.5

Cost Estimates

The feasibility study has identified all the key capital and operating cost components in the Hydrail
System. The cost values that have been used in the Operational Simulation Model have been
obtained for information provided by discussions with industry sources and have been validated
against published data.
As a result of the further system sizing work, concept design work and hydrogen production facility
location work that we have identified above it will be possible to undertake a more formal cost
estimating exercise of the capital and operating costs. This will also be accompanied by a quantified
risk assessment to more accurately evaluate the forecast cost distribution for different risk parameters.
As part of this process there will be a further evaluation of the forecast prices of electricity that it is
appropriate to use in the calculation of the Hydrail System’s operating cost.

6.1.6

Implementation Plan

Section 4.11 of this report provides an initial view of how the Hydrail System could transition into initial
operation. As stated in that section there are many interdependencies of a physical and a timing
nature between the RER program’s infrastructure upgrades and the Hydrail System.
We intend to work with the RER planning team so that we can create a more detailed transition
scenario that integrates with the proposed sequence of infrastructure work and identifies:


Which corridor would be best suited for the initial testing of the HFC rail vehicles



Which corridor would be best suited for the initial revenue service



The preferred sequence of corridors that would then introduce the service and how this would
relate to the incremental build of the hydrogen production, storage and dispensing facilities

6.1.7

Safety Case Roadmap

Section 4.6 of this report provides an overview of the existing codes and standards that apply to
hydrogen systems and identifies the need to undertake work that will:


Assess the risks relating to the operation of the Hydrail System



The development of further codes and standards for the operation of the Hydrail System
particularly in relation to the refuelling subsystem and the rail vehicle subsystem

During the feasibility study the Hydrail team has commenced engagement with Transport Canada and
held initial discussions with them about evaluating the safety risk of the Hydrail System concept.
In taking forward this area of work the Hydrail team intends to form a working committee that will
include Transport Canada, TSSA, CSA, the Canadian Hydrogen Installation Code Standards
Committee and equivalents in the United States. The objective of this group will be to develop a
pathway for the development of a full suite of codes and standards that will apply to Hydrail.

6.1.8

Prototype Hydrail System

Irrespective of how much systems modelling and concept design work is undertaken the complete
viability of the Hydrail System can only be demonstrated by designing, building and operating an
example of the complete end to end system.
At the conclusion of the above activities Metrolinx intends to:


Commission the building of a single prototype HFC Locomotive that can enter revenue service



Commission the development and prototyping of the refueling and hydrogen production subsystems that can work with the prototype HFC Locomotive.

Operating this prototype Hydrail System over an extended period will enable Metrolinx to learn
valuable lessons concerning Hydrail System’s operations, performance and reliability which can then
be fed back into the design and implementation planning of a full Hydrail System.

6.2

Actions to Align the Hydrail System with Provincial
Government Policy

6.2.1

Electricity Price Policy

As outlined in Section 4.4, the calculation of the net present value of the operating cost of the Hydrail
System is sensitive to the forecast hourly prices of electricity from 2025 onwards. For the Hydrail
System to retain its BCR equivalence to the conventional overhead electrification system, the
differential between the average off-peak price of electricity to the average peak price of electricity
needs to remain at the level used in this analysis (which is: off-peak = 0.4 x peak).
Therefore, any narrowing of the differential between the price of electricity paid by Hydrail and that
for conventional electrification would weaken the economic case for Hydrail. Due to the many
variables that could influence the price of off-peak electricity in the future this is considered to be a
highly significant risk (as described in 4.12.3.1).
As a consequence, this risk needs to be mitigated to avoid DBFOM bidders including a substantial
risk premium into their operating cost calculations for the Hydrail System. A recommended next step
is therefore for Metrolinx to engage with the provincial government to determine if it is possible to
define, or pre-establish, the cost of electricity relating to the Hydrail System.

6.2.2

Hydrogen Economy

As outlined in Section 4.9.1, there are opportunities for the Hydrail System to be a catalyst for the
broader adoption of hydrogen in the Ontario economy. As described in Section 4.12.4.4, the benefits
of this Hydrogen Economy concept could be:


Sharing of the costs of implementing the fixed infrastructure assets



Reductions in the use of fossil fuels as energy sources



Development of businesses and jobs with a hydrogen technology focus



The development of Ontario as a global leader in the implementation of hydrogen technologies



Adoption of hydrogen as an energy storage material in combination with renewable energy
sources and the associated benefits in relation to the stabilisation of the electricity grid in response
to variations in demand.

Taking forward the development of those opportunities, which are beyond Metrolinx’s transportation
mandate, will require consideration and guidance from the provincial government, and potentially
part of a broader “hydrogen roadmap”. A recommended next step is therefore to work with the
provincial government to develop a cross-government business case for an Ontario Hydrogen
Economy.

Actions to Integrate the Hydrail System into the
DBFOM Procurement Process

As stated at the start of Section 6.1 one of the objectives of the “Recommended Next Steps” is to
provide high quality information on the Hydrail System to the DBFOM bidders.
As such the Hydrail team will work with the Metrolinx team that is managing the DBFOM procurement
process over the course of 2018 to ensure that the activities to further develop the Hydrail System
concept are aligned with the DBFOM’s timescales and objectives.

Appendix A – Symposium Feedback
A.1.

Introduction

A Hydrail Symposium was conducted by Metrolinx to solicit, gather and analyze feedback from
qualified members of the public, key stakeholders in the Hydrogen industry and private sector
companies that are active in the Hydrogen space. Feedback was solicited in 5 key areas: safety,
implementation, environment, energy and workforce. The key objectives and challenges facing
Metrolinx for each of these categories was gathered from the perspective of the audience. The
common themes around each of these areas are highlight below.
Safety
The Key Objectives identified in the safety category include:


Ensuring adequate training for the entire workforce is conducted as the workforce will need to be
very familiar with the technology to operate and maintain the system, particularly rail operation.
This is best done through a formal and structured training program



Ensuring codes, standards and regulations that are already in place are well known within the
study and key areas of deficiency are identified



Providing proper knowledge transfer to the public through a public education campaign that
shows hydrogen being safe to use; and developing the appropriate methodology of making this
communication effective



Adopting risk assessments to tie in with the communications strategy and comparing to other
energy systems so a proper risk benefit analysis can be conducted

The Key Challenges identified in the safety category include:


Controlling misinformation about Hydrail. In terms of public perception, understanding of
hydrogen is low and this could possibly be the biggest challenge to making it work from a safety
perspective. Getting the public to understand the technology will be very difficult since perception
of safety issues will have to be separated from real safety issues. This will require the support of
media and key government officials



Working with the government and regulatory bodies to develop adequate regulations will be
another challenge since the integration of hydrogen on a rail vehicle has never been done on the
RER scale before

Implementation
The Key Objectives identified in the implementation category include:


Implementing a pilot project immediately with both small and large scale-testing, with a phased-in
approach. This way, the system can be slowly adjusted to accommodate RER, learn lessons along
the way to meet the 2024/25 deadline. The phased-in approach also reduces risk



Develop and maintain stakeholder and government involvement, as well as partnerships with
other organizations



Investing the time and effort to nail down the mechanics of refueling (frequency, cost, and who will
operate) and gather all analytics prior to implementing to deliver on time and on budget. The
process should not be rushed

The Key Challenges identified in the implementation category include:


Delivering on time as per the provincial government promise (which affect public perception) and
maintaining reliability are crucial since Metrolinx will only have one chance at a first impression



Managing costs and expectations from planning, to initiation, to full life cycle is thought to be
difficult



Finding a one-size-fits-all solution for refuelling/hydrogen production given GTHA’s varied
geography, track/station layouts is thought to be another hurdle that could dramatically increase
costs



Implementing/protecting the program if the minister or government changes is to be looked at so
efforts and investments are not wasted

Environment
The Key Objectives identified in the environment category include:


Clearly communicating the environmental benefits of hydrogen to the public, in comparison with
overhead catenary and capturing all pertinent data including air quality, avoiding tree cutting,
GHG reduction, and noise reduction



Managing life cycle costs to ensure all decisions are based on lifetime costs and carbon usage.

The Key Challenges identified in the environment category include:


Managing the life cycle cost and expectations including a full life cycle analysis if needed



Incentivizing people out of their cars and into these new transit options



Coordination of fueling, particularly relating to where to put nodes and hitch stations



Contextualizing the efficiency question and explaining “how using more energy can be a good
thing”

Energy
The Key Objectives identified in the energy category include:


Ensuring the efficient utilization of excess power and contextualizing the future availability of offpeak power



Thorough analysis of costs involved and similar options which need actual life cycle costs, speed,
infrastructure, testing (there is a lack of understanding surrounding whether or not Hydrail will
help bring down costs). This would include explaining the changing dynamics of electricity i.e. the
more infrastructure that uses electricity during off peak, the more the price will increase, and the
need for new, clean electricity generation which will be expensive



Define efficiency for a better understanding of what it entails



Have a holistic approach: impact to the grid as a whole



Comparison of power to create energy of power for vehicle vs energy for locomotives

The Key Challenges identified in the energy category include:


Market changes which affect feasibility of project and the geographical challenges to identify if the
program will change from region to region

Appendix B – Hydrail Safety Review
B.1.

Introduction

The objective of this hydrogen safety review is to assess the hydrogen hazards for the Hydrail System
to identify unresolved safety issues or gaps in the exiting hydrogen installation standards and codes
that would make it unfeasible to use HFC-powered trains.
The scope of this work is to perform a preliminary hydrogen safety review for the Hydrail concept that
consists of the following six system components (shown in Figure B-1):
1. Hydrogen production
2. Hydrogen storage (production site)
3. Hydrogen distribution
4. Hydrogen refill (storage)
5. Hydrogen dispensing
6. Hydrogen vehicle
This safety review will identify the main parts, failures, consequences, potential hazards and
preventative measures. Assessment of the severity or frequency for each failure is outside the scope of
work. The work scope also includes a review of the legal, regulatory & standards that pertain to the
Hydrail System.

Hydrogen Properties Relevant to Hydrogen Safety

B.2.1. Forms of Hydrogen
Hydrogen, the simplest and lightest element on the periodic table, is composed of only one proton
and one electron. Pure hydrogen exists in the form of hydrogen molecules. It coexists in two different
forms, ortho (nuclear spins aligned) and para (spins anti-aligned) hydrogen, whose partition is
dependent on the temperature. Normal hydrogen at room temperature is 75 percent ortho and
25 percent para. Hydrogen can exist in gaseous, liquid, or slush forms. The normal boiling and
melting points of hydrogen is 20.3 K and 14.1 K, respectively, at the absolute pressure of 101.325 kPa.

B.2.2. Physical Properties of Hydrogen
The physical properties of hydrogen relevant to safety are summarized as follows220:


At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a colourless, tasteless, odorless, non-toxic,
and non-corrosive gas. It is the lightest gas, being 1/14 as dense as air. It is positively buoyant
above a temperature of 22 K, i.e., over almost the entire temperature range of its gaseous state.



Because of its small size, small molecular weight and low viscosity, H2 has an enhanced propensity
to leak. Rates of any leakage are enhanced by a factor of 50 higher than for water and 10 for
nitrogen.



In a pure hydrogen environment, hydrogen molecules collide with each other and bonds can be
broken. H+ can penetrate barrier diaphragms. At elevated temperatures and pressures, hydrogen
can cause severe decarburization and embrittlement for steels. This is a serious concern in any
situation involving storage or transfer of H2 under pressure.



Liquid hydrogen (LH2) is a colourless, odourless, and non-corrosive liquid. It is relatively
unreactive. It is categorized as a cryogenic fluid (<-73°C). Any liquid hydrogen splashed on to the
skin or in the eyes can cause serious burns by frostbite or hypothermia. LH2 will rapidly boil or
flash at all temperatures above its boiling point of 20 K. When evaporated from open LH2 pools,
cold H2 is more viscous than ambient gas and thus more prone to the formation of a flammable
mixture with air. In confined areas, when LH2 is heated up to ambient conditions, the local
atmosphere may change drastically due to the volume increase.

B.2.3. Gas Mixing
H2 by itself is harmless, save for asphyxiation. It must be mixed with air in the right proportion to form
combustible mixtures. The severity of combustion is strongly dependent upon the hydrogen
concentration in air. H2 mixing in air is by two transport processes; mass diffusion and convection.
Diffusion is the transport process in which the rate of transport of hydrogen is directly proportional to,
and in the opposite direction of, the hydrogen concentration gradient in the hydrogen-air mixture.
Diffusion will reduce the hydrogen concentration gradients and over time will result in a uniform
distribution.
Convection is the transport process where the gas mixture is moved in the opposite direction of the
pressure gradient. This movement of gases has local differences in momentum and velocity
(magnitude and direction) which creates eddies and turbulences that result in mixing of the gas

constituents. There are two types of convection. The first is forced convection whereby the gases are
moved by active systems such as a fan (part of a ventilation system) or a strong wind. The other type of
convection is called free convection which is due to buoyancy that results from local gas density
differences. With hydrogen being significantly lighter than air, the buoyancy forces are very strong,
helping to move the hydrogen upwards. As it moves upwards, it mixes with the entrained air and
becomes diluted, spreading outwards. This strong positive buoyancy of hydrogen is a favourable
safety feature in unconfined areas, but can cause a hazardous situation in (partially) confined spaces,
where the hydrogen can accumulate, e.g., underneath a roof. The rapid mixing of hydrogen with air
can lead to flammable mixtures very quickly, but on the other hand dilute mixtures to the nonflammable range quickly too.

B.2.4. Combustion
Owing to its small molecule size, hydrogen is particularly prone to leakage within a system or to the
surroundings. A potential fire hazard always exists when hydrogen is present and an oxidant exists
due to its reactivity. A hydrogen flame is colourless. Any visibility is caused by impurities.
The hydrogen properties that make it more prone to combustion are summarized as follows221:


Almost all metals and non-metals react with hydrogen at high temperatures.



Mixtures containing 4 to 75 percent H2 by volume in air or up to 94 percent in oxygen are
flammable. The detonable range is given to be 18 - 59 percent H2 in air, however, the range was
found to depend on the system size.



The minimum ignition energy is 0.02 mJ for H2-air mixtures, much lower than hydrocarbon-air
mixtures. A weak spark or the electrostatic discharge by a flow of pressurized H2 gas or by a
person (~10 mJ) would suffice for an ignition.



The burning velocity is 2.6 m/s for stoichiometric H2 in air and 11.8 m/s in pure oxygen, much
higher than other hydrocarbon fuels because of its fast chemical kinetics and high diffusivity.
Higher burning velocities produce rapid pressure rises and greater chance for a transition from
deflagration to detonation (DDT).



Hydrogen produces more heat per unit mass (LHV = 120,000 kJ/kg) than any other automotive
fuel, but a relatively low heating value per unit of volume unless compressed or liquefied.



At one atmosphere, the quenching distance is about 0.06 cm for hydrogen compared to 0.2 cm
for propane.

Combustion of premixed H2-air mixtures can occur as a deflagration or detonation. Both forms are
often regarded as an "explosion”. When hydrogen is leaked in the form of a jet, typically at a failed
static or dynamic seal, the jet of hydrogen will mix with air and possibly form a jet fire (or so-called
diffusion flame or standing flame). The characteristics of each combustion form are defined as follows:


A deflagration is a subsonic wave with typical velocities on the order of several meters per second.
It is also an expansion wave with both pressure and density decreasing across the reaction front.
The propagation of a deflagration is caused by the diffusion and convection of heat and
intermediate reaction species from the flame to the unburned gas. The deflagration pressure is
spatially uniform and bounded by the adiabatic isochoric (constant volume) complete combustion
(AICC) pressure. For stoichiometric H2-air mixtures, the AICC pressure of confined deflagration

is 8.3 atm at ambient temperature and pressure. In contrast, the deflagration overpressure of an
unconfined hydrogen-air gas cloud is in the order of 10 kPa.


A detonation, the most energetic form of combustion, is a supersonic wave, with typical velocities
on the order of a few kilometers per second. It is a compression shock wave with pressure and
density increasing across the wave. It is caused by heating of the unburned gas via a shock wave
(created by the energy release in the reaction zone) to temperatures capable of causing ignition in
the unburned gas. As a result, the reaction front is coupled to the shock wave and they propagate
at the same velocity. The detonation velocity for hydrogen is in the range of 2000 m/s and the
pressure ratio across a detonation wave is approximately 15 for stoichiometric H2-air mixture.

A detonation can be initiated directly via strong ignition sources, such as high energy explosives,
strong shock waves and high voltage discharges. However, it is more often initiated by a process that
starts from a deflagration and accelerates to a fast flame and transition to detonation (so-called DDT).


Diffusion flames take place when fuel and oxidizer are physically separate so that the energy
release is limited primarily by the mixing process. The fuel and oxidizer mixing may occur in two
ways: (1) molecular diffusion, where mixing is relatively slow and (2) turbulent mass transfer or
eddy diffusion, where mass transfer is much more rapid. Flame length is an essential measure of
jet fire, which is the distance that all the jet fluid has mixed and reacted with the atmosphere.

B.2.5. Material Interaction
Hydrogen is relatively inert towards most solid materials that may be used to contain it. However, it is
such a small molecule, it can penetrate many materials at normal temperatures. In some materials, this
means it permeates and can be lost from a container. In other materials, the hydrogen can enter the
material structure and change its properties. Most metallic and ceramic materials are relatively
impervious to hydrogen, whereas many polymers are to some degree permeable.

B.2.5.1 Hydrogen Embrittlement
The mechanism of hydrogen embrittlement in structural metals is not well-understood, but it is related
to the ability of hydrogen to dissociate or move around in and between the metal crystal structures. A
few metals have structures that allow significant permeation of hydrogen at ambient or modest
temperatures. Some of these are commonly used for containing gases and can suffer significant loss
of ductility when exposed to hydrogen or if hydrogen is incorporated during fabrication. This effect is
dependent on the metal microstructure, metal stress, certain impurities (metal or hydrogen),
temperature and hydrogen pressure. High-strength steel is the most common material of particular
concern; whereas, mild steel, austenitic stainless steel, aluminum, and copper alloys are considered to
be largely safe from the effect when not exposed at high temperature. The main means of avoiding
hydrogen embrittlement is by careful selection of materials and designs that limit stress
concentrations. Embrittlement is most often a result of incorporation of hydrogenated compounds
during welding and heat treatment rather than simple exposure to H2.

B.2.5.2 Hydrogen Permeation
Hydrogen can diffuse through some engineering polymers at rates sufficient to be of concern from
the point of view of flammability or loss of gas. The range of permeability is very broad and can vary
by at least 2 orders of magnitude between different types of polymers, but typically elastomers are
significantly more permeable than rigid materials. There is normally no chemical interaction; the
process is purely physical—a combination of solubility and diffusivity. In practice, the concerns will be

mostly at mechanical piping connections with elastomer seals (e.g. flanges) or in very high-pressure
H2 storage vessels made with polymeric materials.

B.3.

Hazard Assessment of Hydrail System Components

B.3.1. Hydrogen Production
For the Hydrail project, hydrogen production is by low-temperature electrolysis of water in a large
industrial installation. Water electrolysis is a very well-established technology, with very well
understood process components and methods of controlling the hazards. From the electrolysis unit,
the hydrogen will be compressed for storage as gas, or compressed, cooled and liquefied for storage
as liquid. This, too, is a well-established industrial process.
An industrial plant specifically for the sole purpose of hydrogen production is well positioned to be
engineered with active and passive features to minimize hydrogen hazards for all operational and
failure modes. It is standard procedure to perform a formalized hazards and operability study, Failure
Modes and Effects Analysis, or both during the design of a new plant. The major concern is
flammability of hydrogen and most of the hydrogen-related safety features are designed first to limit
the ability of hydrogen to mix with air, then to ensure any unwanted mixing stays below the lower
flammability limit and finally to avoid the presence of sources of ignition. Table B-1 briefly lists the
failures, hazards and mitigation measures for hydrogen production.

B.3.2. Hydrogen Storage (Production Site)
B.3.2.1 Gaseous Hydrogen
Gaseous storage of hydrogen is assumed to be in relatively low pressure compressed gas tanks.
Weight is not an issue, so it seems logical to rule out Class III and IV, which are more expensive. Type I
is the lowest cost, and generally consists of a seamless steel or aluminum tank with a maximum
pressure of 25 MPa. Type II consists of a seamless metallic tank, but hoop wrapped with fibre resin to
increase its maximum pressure to 45-80 MPa. Type II is more costly than Type I because of the fibre
resin wrap.
A quick internet search found the largest commercially available hydrogen storage tank had a
capacity of showed that commercially available hydrogen storage tanks have a 15 m3 capacity
(30 MPa). To meet the hydrogen storage requirements for the Hydrail project will require hundreds of
these tanks.
Hundreds of 30 MPa storage tanks (commercially available 30 MPa hydrogen storage tanks have a
maximum capacity of about 15 m3) will be needed to store the thousands of cubic metres of hydrogen
required by the Hydrail project. This will require a significant amount of piping and valving to move
the hydrogen to all these distributed tanks. These tanks will also need valves (including check valves)
to allow each tank to be isolated, so that in the event a pressurization event occurs for one tank and
the pressure relief device or temperature/pressure relief device activates, only the affected tank will
release its content.
An assessment of the hazards for gaseous hydrogen storage at the production site is shown in
Table B-2. Many of the failures leads to a release of hydrogen from either the storage tank or the
attached components (e.g. pipes, fittings, pressure relief devices). This hydrogen release can result in
a formation of a combustible cloud. The hydrogen release can also result in a standing flame at the

release point. Large sudden releases can also result in over-pressurization of a confined space. The
general preventative measures to protect from the potential hazards for a hydrogen release are:




Located in a confined space:


Periodic inspection and leak testing



Barriers to protect against external impacts



Exclusion zone


No ignition sources



No obstructions to aid in flame acceleration/DDT



Limited personnel access



Ventilation is required to guard against hydrogen accumulation. However, Ventilation may not
be sufficient for large sudden releases. Blow-out panels (needed for protection against
pressurization) will need to be located to aid in venting of hydrogen.



Blow out panels to protect the confined space against pressurization due to large sudden
releases of H2 or pressurization due to combustion.





Pressure monitoring and warning system for unexpected depressurization of the component

Two other failure mechanisms need further discussion. The first is the possible introduction of air into
the system to form a combustible hydrogen-air mixture within the tank/pipes. The preventative
measure is to monitor for the presence of oxygen (or air) in the tanks/pipes. The second failure is
related to the temperature and pressure relief devices used to protect the storage tanks from failure
due to over-pressurization. They are designed to remain open once activated. Their preventative
measures include limiting the vent size to adequately provide pressure protection, but also to limit the
size of the hydrogen cloud. As well, the vent should be directed away from personnel, energy sources
and control/safety systems. These TPRD/PRD will also require protection against ice build-up.

B.3.2.2 Liquid Hydrogen
Liquid hydrogen is stored at low (cryogenic, -245°C) temperatures and at pressures of 0.6 MPa. The
liquid hydrogen storage is a Dewar, double-walled, vacuum-insulated vessel made of steel alloys. The
inherent heat transfer from the surroundings, through the vessel walls will cause the hydrogen to
evaporate/boil inside the tank. This build-up of hydrogen causes a pressure rise inside the vessel. The

H2 is vented to maintain a vessel pressure below its normal operating pressure (about 0.6 MPa). The
amount of hydrogen released vented is called boil-off. The main components of a liquid hydrogen
tank are:


Double-walled, vacuum insulated vessel made of steel alloys



Shut-off devices



Boil-off system



Pressure relief devices (PRDs)



The interconnecting piping and fittings between the components

NASA stores its liquid hydrogen in a 3,218 m3 vacuum bottle, which is more than 5 times the
estimated amount of liquid hydrogen required for the Hydrail project. This indicates that all liquid
hydrogen needed for the Hydrail project can be stored in one vessel. This would make a liquid
hydrogen storage facility much simpler logistically. However, a failure of one component can result in
the discharge of the entire volume of liquid hydrogen.
An assessment of the hazards for liquid hydrogen storage at the production site is shown in Table B-3.
A release of liquid hydrogen would vaporize upon contacting the outside environment (its
vaporization rate will be dependent upon the rate of heat transfer to the liquid hydrogen) to form a
relative cold H2 cloud with a possibility to form a heavier than air hydrogen cloud that can remain
grounded. As well, the lower temperatures of the H2 will reduce its buoyancy and diffusion with air.
Asphyxiation is more of a possibility, even in unconfined space. The resulting hydrogen cloud can also
be combusted. The preventative measures for liquid hydrogen release includes:


Common:


Periodic inspection



Barriers to protect against external impacts



Exclusion zone


No ignition sources



No obstructions to aid in flame acceleration/DDT



Limited personnel access



Liquid hydrogen liquid level monitoring and warning system for unexpected loss of liquid
hydrogen



Liquid hydrogen temperature monitoring and warning system for unexpected rise in
temperature.



Select materials that are less susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement (low carbon, low allow
and low strength steels are less susceptible)



Isolation from heat sources



Direct liquid hydrogen flow to safe areas





Located in a confined space:


Ventilation may not be sufficient. Blow-out panels (needed for protection against
pressurization) will need to be located to aid in venting of hydrogen.

Blow out panels to protect against pressurization due to high expansion ratio for liquid
hydrogen to gas.



Hydrogen detection and warning system

Located in an unconfined space:


Underlying these preventative measures is the importance of maintaining the integrity of the vacuum
insulation between the inner and outer walls of the liquid hydrogen storage tank.
If the release path is connected to the gas space of the liquid storage system, then gaseous hydrogen
will be released, but limited to the boil-off rate. The same potential hazards and preventative
measures for gaseous hydrogen storage would apply.

B.3.3. Hydrogen Distribution
Hydrogen can be transported and distributed from a centralized production site to the consumer by
compressed gas using pipelines or by compressed gas or liquid using ships, railways or road tankers.
Hydrogen pipeline delivery is considered a cost-effective way to move hydrogen from its production
location to end users, though usually only at large volumes. The cost to construct a large-scale,
dedicated hydrogen pipeline system can be very high depending on the distance and capacity. An
alternative delivery pathway for large volume and long distance is to use the existing natural gas
pipelines by blending hydrogen with the natural gas222 . The pipeline delivery system usually consists
of compressor stations, transmission (mains) and distribution (customers) lines, regulators and meters.
The potential hazards associated with transport of gaseous hydrogen using existing natural gas
pipelines are summarized in Table B-4. The primary prevention measures for the pipeline associated
with fire or explosion are:


Regular in-line inspection



Leak detection or cathodic protection monitoring system



Sufficient venting in confined service areas



Limited H2 fraction in the blends with natural gas (i.e., less than 50 percent).

Road transport of gaseous hydrogen is presently carried out using trucks with steel cylinders of up to
90 litres at 200 – 250 bar pressure or large seamless cylinders called “tubes” of up to 3000 litres at
200 – 250 bar. For transport in larger scale, pressure of up to 500-600 bars or even higher may be
employed. However, a 40-ton truck can only carry 400 kg compressed hydrogen because of the
weight of a 200 bar pressure vessel. The gaseous hydrogen distribution by trailers consists of
pressurized tubes, connection hose and PRD. The potential hazards associated with transport of
pressurized gaseous hydrogen by tube trailers are summarized in Table B-5.
Liquid hydrogen road transport using a cryogenic tank is carried out using trucks which can exceed a
capacity of 60,000 litres. However, liquefaction process is both time consuming and energy
demanding. Liquid hydrogen is difficult to store over a long period (loss by vaporization) and the

insulated tank may be large and bulky. The liquid hydrogen delivery system consists of storage tanks
(inner and outer tanks), connecting hose, heat exchanger and pressure regulating valves. The
potential hazards associated with transport of liquid hydrogen by road are summarized in Table B-6.
The primary prevention measures for both delivery methods associated with fire or explosion are:


Regular inspection of the storage tanks and PRD



Sufficient driver training for unloading and re-fill and operating procedure



H2 detection system in the loading and staging area



Separation distance between loading vehicles and from H2 fill to gasoline storage

B.3.4. Hydrogen Refill (Local storage at refuelling site)
B.3.4.1 Gaseous Hydrogen
The Hydrail project proposes to store gaseous hydrogen at refilling stations at 87.5 MPa. This can be
accommodated by TYPE II and IV gaseous hydrogen storage tanks. Type II consists of a seamless
metallic tank, hoop wrapped with fibre resin to increase its maximum pressure to 45-80 MPa
(literature suggests that the maximum pressure for Type II tanks are unlimited). Type IV hydrogen
storage tanks employ a non-metallic liner (e.g. plastic as a permeation barrier) wrapped in a
fibre/epoxy matrix (for strength). Literature search indicates that most of the research/development of
Type IV tanks are for use in cars, with working pressure of 70 to 80 MPa. These maximum pressures for
Type II and IV tanks may not meet the Hydrail requirement to store gaseous hydrogen at 87.5 MPa.
Thus, a booster compressor would be required to meet the pressure needed to fill the 70 MPa onboard storage tanks (on the trains). Type IV tanks are significantly lighter than Type II, but with a
significantly higher cost. The weight of the storage tanks is not a factor for stationary hydrogen
storage at a refilling station. Thus, it is recommended that gaseous hydrogen be stored in Type II
hydrogen storage tanks at the refilling stations. Hazards associated with Type II gaseous hydrogen
storage is already covered in Table B-2 and discussed in Section 3.2.1. The only difference being the
higher-pressure tanks will result in higher hydrogen release rates from a break (in the tank wall) as
compared to the gaseous hydrogen stored in lower pressures storage tanks at production sites.

B.3.4.2 Liquid Hydrogen
Liquid storage at the hydrogen refilling station is essentially the same as liquid hydrogen storage at
the production site, except for a lower storage volume. Thus, the hazards assessment for liquid
hydrogen storage (production site) shown in Table B-3 and discussed in Section 3.2.2 would apply for
liquid hydrogen storage at the refilling station.

B.3.5. Hydrogen Dispensing
The fueling dispenser contains controls, fuel metering, and a connection from the fueling hose Error!
Reference source not found.]. It draws fuel from the hydrogen refill storage tanks and the controls
determine the final fill pressure on the vehicle. The dispenser meters the quantity of fuel transferred to
achieve the design pressure. The potential hazards associated with dispensing gaseous hydrogen are
summarized in Table B-7 and in Table B-8 for liquid hydrogen. The primary prevention measures for
fire or explosion for dispensing are:


Regular inspection of the cascade control, dispensing hose and nozzle, and emergency shut offs



Leak check prior to fill



Isolation vales for breakaway connection and shut off valves for dispenser

B.3.6. Hydrogen Vehicle (On-train use of hydrogen)
The passenger train can be driven by either a single locomotive with fuel storage, fuel cells and
batteries aboard, a single locomotive and a fuel tender, or an EMU consisting of separately driven
units with fuel storage, fuel cells, and batteries aboard each. The hazards associated with each part of
the power generation system on a train are not significantly different from the case for stationary
systems such as already discussed for hydrogen storage and distribution. However, combining the
equipment necessary for powering the train in a small space creates additional hazards and making
them mobile with passengers nearby further complicates the safety considerations.
If the greatest concern is for the large amount of hydrogen stored in the tanks, this may advocate for a
design that uses a fuel tender to separate the fuel from the engine and the passengers. It may also
lead to the use of gaseous storage with multiple independently isolatable tanks to limit the volume of
hydrogen released from a tank rupture. In addition, compressed hydrogen stored in roof
compartments helps ensure that any release is most likely to vent away from people.
The potential hazards associated with the three parts of the power system are summarized in
Table B-9 to Table B-11.

B.3.7. Summary
The potential hazards for the different component failures for the Hydrail system are outlined in
Sections 3.1 to 3.6. Although there are potential hazards associated with the use of hydrogen,
preventative measures are available that can be employed to prevent or mitigate the impact of the
potential hazards. Thus, there are no unresolvable safety issues surrounding the use of hydrogen for
the Hydrail system.
Many of the failures leads to release of hydrogen that leads to formation of combustible hydrogen-air
mixtures with the potential for a fire or explosion. Safety analysis will need to be performed to study
hydrogen dispersion and combustion for these failures/accidents. This will require the use of qualified
computer codes that are supported by validation against relevant experimental datasets.

Appendix C – Ontario Rail Sector
This section provides an overall description of Ontario’s rail sector, including its geography,
organizational structure, and bilateral arrangements in the context of regulations and legislation. This
sets the background for the sections on system design, regulations and standards, and
implementation.

C.1.1. Rail Market and Regulatory Overview
The Ontario Rail Market is served by a multitude of different passenger and freight service providers
that can be grouped in different sectors, as follows:


National Operators: VIA Rail (VIA), CP, and CN



International Services: Amtrak, CN, CP, and CSX Corporation



Regional Passenger and Freight Operators: Ontario Northland Railway and KWG Resources
(KWG)



Regional Passenger Operators: GO, Union Pearson (UP) Express, Algoma Central Railway, and
Moose Consortium Inc. (Moose)



Local and Regional Freight Operators: Cando Ltd, Essex Terminal Railway, Goderich Exeter
Railway, Huron Central Railway, Ontario Southland Railway, Ottawa Valley Railway, Port Colborne
Harbour Railway, Southern Ontario Railway, Vale Railway (Vale), and VIP Rail



Tourist Services: Agawa Canyon Tour Train, Credit Valley Explorer, Huntsville & Lake of Bays
Railway, Port Stanley Terminal Railway, and many other operators dedicated to a single operating
site



Metros and Trams: Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) Metro and streetcars or light rail vehicles
(LRVs), Ottawa O-train light rapid transit (LRT), and in the near future, the Confederation Line and
other upcoming LRV service expansion in Waterloo

Some of those service providers may be able to operate under special operating conditions or
adaptation of existing rules, but this is only possible if they operate on their own dedicated rail
network, have no interaction with other rolling stock equipment, or both.
This is not the case for Metrolinx RER, one of the largest infrastructure programs ever undertaken by
the Government of Ontario that will transform how people move across the Greater Toronto and
Hamilton Area (GTHA). As demonstrated on Figure , the GO rail network already interacts with
multiple rail network and rolling stock technologies.

HYDRAIL FEASIBILITY STUDY REPORT

As such, any new equipment that needs to be introduced on this corridor, including new passenger
coaches or new powered cars (diesel, electric, hybrid hydrogen, or any other propulsion mode), will
need to meet a list of existing Canadian regulatory requirements, standards, and recommended
practices. For example, as a minimum, rolling stock equipment will need to be designed to comply
with the following:


Railway Safety Act (RSA), including locomotive emissions regulations



Transport Canada standards, including:


Transport Canada Railway Locomotive Inspection and Safety Rules



Transport Canada TC-O-0-26 Railway Passenger Car Inspection and Safety Rules



Rules for the Installation and Testing of Air Reservoirs (Other than on Locomotive)



Railway Freight and Passenger Train Brake Inspection and Safety Rules



Rules Respecting Track Safety (TC E-54)



Standards Respecting Railway Clearances (TC E-05)



Railway Safety Appliance Standards Regulations, Canadian Transport Commission General
Order Number (No.) O-10



Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA) standards



Canada Labour Code



Canadian Environmental Protection Act



Canada Occupational Safety and Health Regulations (OSHA)



Onboard Trains Occupational Health and Safety



Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)



CSA standards

Because some of the equipment operated on the GO network has been designed with United States
(U.S.) standards, and because those requirements are not necessarily covered by Canadian
regulations, the U.S. ADA, as well as the following U.S. organizations’ standards, or portions of them,
would also be applicable to new equipment design:


American Public Transportation Association (APTA)



National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)



U.S. Environmental Protection Agency



FRA



Association of American Railroads (AAR)



ASTM International (ASTM)



In addition to these requirements, Metrolinx may also have their own sets of O&M guidelines or
specific requirements that will also need to be considered for all new rolling stock equipment.

C.1.2. The GO Transit Network
Since May 1967, GO has evolved from a single GO train line along Lake Ontario’s shoreline into an
extensive network of train lines and bus routes. GO operates seven train lines - Lakeshore West,
Milton, Kitchener, Barrie, Richmond Hill, Stouffville, and Lakeshore East - serving 64 stations over
488 route-kilometres (km), as illustrated on Figure . GO also operates an air-rail link, called the UP
Express. This service operates every 15 minutes between Union Station and Pearson Airport, with a
journey time of 25 minutes.
FIGURE C-2 GO TRANSIT OPERATIONAL LINES

Although GO owns most of its operating network, it also needs to operate on infrastructure owned
and operated by CN and CP, as previously depicted on Figure (refer to Section 4.1.1). Table C-1
presents the track ownership for all corridors operated by GO, expressed in kilometres of tracks for
each segment. Over the entire 488-km network, 390 km, or 80 percent, of GO operates on
infrastructure it owns. Lakeshore East, Barrie, Stouffville, and UP Express are 100 percent owned,
meaning there are no additional requirements before new equipment can be tested or enter into
passenger revenue service on those corridors, as described in Section 4.1.1.
This is not the case for Lakeshore West, Milton, Kitchener, and Richmond Hill corridors that need to be
operated on infrastructure owned by either CN or CP, or both. For those cases, additional reviews,
inspections, and approvals will be required by the owner(s) of the infrastructure before the equipment
would be allowed to operate.
CN transports more than $250 billion worth of goods annually for a wide range of business sectors,
ranging from resource products, to manufactured products, to consumer goods, across a rail network
of approximately 32,000 route-km spanning Canada and mid-America.

This partial ownership by the freight railroads limits the expansion capability beyond the current RER
electrification scenario, as shown on Figure , to a completely electrified solution. The need to carry
double-stacked containers on the freight railroads is the primary reason why those sections of the
network cannot be electrified.

FIGURE C-3 RER CURRENT ELECTRIFICATION SCENARIO236

The network is also shared with VIA and Amtrak. Although they do have access to a portion of the
network, and some of the Union Station tracks and platforms are dedicated for their operation,
because they do not own any of this infrastructure, they do not impose any specific requirements to
the rolling stock technology that can be operated on GO.
VIA is currently considering replacing its existing aging fleet in the Quebec-Windsor corridor. Given
the current electrification projects in the Montreal and Toronto area, and potential construction of new
electrified tracks to offer high-frequency intercity rail service, VIA is also considering the procurement
of a trainset that could operate in diesel and electric modes. If electrification was not implemented in
the Toronto area, this could modify or simplify the technology that VIA is presently specifying, and
would require operation in diesel mode in the Toronto area.
