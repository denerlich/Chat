1.Introduction
1.1Purpose
Metrolinx (Contracting Authority) has engaged the ONxpress Transportation Partners Inc. Joint Venture (ONxpress) to design and build the GO Rail Expansion-On-Corridor Program (OnCorr).
The purpose of this report is to describe the basis of design for the development of the cable containment design, external to buildings, associated with the ONxpress CC (Civil) Infrastructure track works to deliver passenger service improvements through the implementation of successive configuration states. Each Configuration State (CS) represents a significant upgrade to the GO Transit Railway System infrastructure and service.
This report documents the specific design criteria and fundamental design guidelines to be adhered to throughout the execution of the project, and establishes the:
Minimum design standards
Safety of personnel and equipment
Legal regulatory and statutory requirements
Environmental and sustainable development objectives
Minimum life-cycle costs.
This document is intended for use by the cable containment design team and other design disciplines, as well as any external design consultants engaged to perform design work for the project, whether in direct support or within the scope of external design limits.
This report should be read in conjunction with the latest version of the Project Agreement (PA) and other Construction Package Type specific Basis of Design reports (refer to Section 2). This report is part of the Design Development phase with the objective to:
Document the rationale, criteria, principles, assumptions, and constraints used for the detailed design of the project.
Identify discipline design Standards, Codes and Practices to apply to the design approach and maintain consistency and efficiency throughout the Program.
Propose integrated design procedures for elements of scope requiring multiple design disciplines.
The information presented herein relies on the Canadian Electrical Code. Part I [1], especially Section 12 – Wiring Methods and on the Ontario Electrical Safety Code (OESC).[28]. For underground systems in the railway right-of-way (ROW), it relies on CSA C22.3 No. 7 Underground Systems [3], whereas for cabling systems installed inside substation premises, it relies on IEEE Std. 525 [4].
NFPA130 [5] is also considered, more particularly Chapter 12 – Wire and Cable Requirements.
1.2GO Rail Expansion – On Corridor
GO Transit is a regional transit system serving the Golden Horseshoe region of Ontario with hub at Union Station in Toronto. It operates on infrastructure that is either owned by Metrolinx (MX territory), or by third parties such as CN or CPR (non-MX territory).
GO Rail Expansion is a program which will provide more travel options for residents and commuters. Upon delivery, the GO Rail Expansion program will provide faster, more frequent, two-way, all-day service on core segments of the GO rail network.
The On-Corridor Works project is a part of the Province's GO Rail Expansion. Under the GO Expansion, the fleet is expected to switch to electric locomotive. There are no further indications of specific vehicle requirements.
1.3ONxpress CC (Civil) Infrastructure Trackwork
The Civil Infrastructure Trackwork includes the construction of new and modification of existing sections of track, including alignment, cable containment, grading, drainage, addition, or modification to retaining walls, relocation of utilities, noise barriers, fences, removal or modification of level crossings and modifications to existing stations, foundations for overhead catenary system (OCS), specific to the work required to achieve the Service Level for each Configuration State.

Figure 1: ONxpress CC (Civil) Infrastructure Track Works Development Context Plan
This Basis of Design report is initially focused on the Bundle 1 Development Phase Early Works identified by ONxpress as the locations of the early design works priority for CJV and CJV Engineering, as illustrated in Figure 1 and summarized in Table 1. This includes the requirements for cable containment at 16 different locations, across the GO Transit Corridors.

1.4ONxpress Cable Containment Works
The ONxpress Cable Containment Works encompass the cabling infrastructure designed to host Metrolinx-owned cables in the railway Right-of-Way, including in bridge crossings, underpasses, through stations, as well as outside substations, technical and layover facilities, both above and below ground. The routing of cables inside buildings is not part of the cable containment works scope. The infrastructure for third-party cabling is also not part of the cable containment works scope.
Figure 2 illustrates a typical cross-section. The cable troughs shown (in red for power cable and optical fiber and in green for communications cables) represent the scope covered by this current document. All other elements are the responsibility of other disciplines and are covered by their own documents. Refer to Section 2 for references to these documents.

Figure 2: Delineation of Basis of Design Reports per Construction Package Type
The cross section shown in the figure above is provided for visual purposes only and the values provided in the figure are not to be used for design purposes and does not reflect the proposed design of the cable containment works.
The design requirements for the civil earthworks, storm water catchment areas and ditches, drainage, adjacent laydown areas and access roads at the limits of and beyond the corridor right-of way are document in the Civil Infrastructure Line Works Basis of Design report (Ref.: ONC-ECW-0000-SWS-PWS-EGM-DCR-00001).

5.Safety Assurance
Safe solutions are part of the core values, thus will be embedded in all design aspects related to the Infrastructure Civil Works. The design process will ensure compliance to applicable codes, regulations, standards, as well as project-specific safety requirements. 
6.Level of Development
The Level of Development (LOD) is a reference tool intended to improve the quality of communication among users of the Building Information Models (BIMs) about the characteristics of elements in the model. RER3-ECW-PW-0000-SWS-IDD-MTX-00001 is the LOD matrix which has been developed for the project and details the development anticipated at each stage of the design phase (i.e., DDD, DDS, CDS, IFC etc.,).
7.Survey
As per the PA Schedule C-6, there are several types of surveys required for the project works. The following surveys will be incorporated into the design of civil earthworks, as a design input from CJV, and will interface with their respective survey requirements memorandums.
Control Survey
Legal Survey
Topographical Survey
Pre- and Post-Construction Utility Survey
Structures and Pavement Condition Survey
CCTV Survey.
Survey type and requirements shall be in accordance with RER3-ECW-PW-0000-SWS-SUR-TMO-00001 – Technical Memo EJV Survey Requirements. For areas requiring further detail or specific requirements, a site-specific Topographical Survey Memo will be prepared and provided to CJV. 
At the time of publishing of this document, the following topographical surveys are being used as the basis of design. As more topographical survey data is received, the latest data set shall be incorporated at the appropriate time.

9.Construction Work Packages Scope Description
The cable containment design scope encompasses the following Construction Work Packages:
9.1Corridors Scope Description
The Electrical and Mechanical Joint Venture (E&M) is responsible for the design of the system’s signalling and cabling, as well as for any requirements pertaining to cable installation. These requirements are exported to CJV Engineering’s cable containment discipline and form part of the inputs required to proceed with the dimensioning and design of the cable containment infrastructure. The interface with E&M is described in ICD E&M Cable Routing General Specification / CJV Cable Containment [29].
E&M’s approach is to deploy the E&M design in stages once the cable containment infrastructure has been put in place in these areas. To do so, the main cable containment infrastructure extending to the adjacent signal houses on both sides of each construction stage is required. The tables in each of the following subsections identify the start and end chainages of all the construction stages and the chainages of adjacent bungalows. Cable containment design will be developed by stage, taking the PREVIOUS BUNGALOW and NEXT BUNGALOW chainages as start and end chainages to ensure data is available to allow the construction stages to be built in any sequence.
9.1.1Lakeshore West Corridor – Oakville Subdivision
The Lakeshore West Corridor covers the Oakville subdivision, from the western limit of USRC all the way to Burlington. It has a length of about 50 km and is 3 to 4 mainline tracks wide.
34 bridges can be found in the corridor. Bridges will be grouped by bridge type, with each of these requiring a specific cable containment solution given the limited structure widths. Refer to Section 11.3.2.4 for the design approach on bridge crossings. Table 6 lists the bridges and their location on the corridor.

* New grade separation – road under rail
The Kitchener corridor has several specificities. It has two tunnels. The West Tunnel spans chainages 14+052 to 14+437 and the 401/409 tunnel is located at chainage 17+087.
At chainage 34+523, the CANDU Railway is crossing the tracks at grade.
The Pearson Leg towards the airport is elevated and will require a dedicated cable containment design compatible with the structure.
There are 48 at-grade road crossings and 14 stations where the cable containment design will be space-constrained and where bespoke solutions will be required.

To ensure enough routes remain operational at any one time to provide for unaffected service, reconstruction in this area will be performed in stages (here stage has the meaning of phase). The cable containment scope and areas of intervention are described in each of the corresponding sub-sections.
In addition to the scope described below, some under track crossings (UTX) will need to be built in areas where tracks are neither modified nor reconfigured. For these areas, the construction can take place in any of the Stages, contingent on track availability.
Moreover, areas of passive protection at USRC will be considered during the design phase (refer to Section 12.6).
9.1.7.1Stage 0
During Stage 0, the focus for cable containment will be to integrate E&M needs with the Union Station Enhancement Project (USEP), done by others, and affecting Platforms 12, 13 and 15, as shown on Figure 3. Of note, cable containment infrastructure will be required to interconnect the South side of Track 15 to Tracks 11, 12, and 13.
Involvement may also be required in case the modified wayside signalling system requires additional cable containment infrastructure to support South tracks modifications.
Partial construction of several under track crossings (UTX) will also take place during this phase for the portion located underneath the affected tracks. The South side cable containment infrastructure will also be installed in that phase.



Figure 3: USRC Staging


Stage 1
In Stage 1, involvement may be required to support the modified wayside signalling system and North tracks modifications.
Partial construction of several under track crossings (UTX) will also take place during this phase for the portions located underneath the modified tracks.
The North side cable containment infrastructure will also be installed in that phase.
Stage 2
For Stage 2, the reconfiguration of tracks 4, 5, and 6 will enable the continuation of construction of several UTX as well as the installation of a longitudinal cable containment infrastructure, both on the East and West portions of USRC.
Stage 3
In Stage 3, the construction of new Tracks 7, 9E, and 9W will enable the partial construction of several UTX under these tracks. As for the other stages, shunt cable containment paths will be built to accommodate the reconfiguration of the signalling configuration if required.
Stage 4
During Stage 4, the unfinished portions of UTX will be completed around Track 10W and 11W.
Stage 5
Cable containment infrastructure affected by the re-building of Platforms 6/7 and 12/13, if any, will be modified as required.
9.2Logistics Sites Scope Definition
Cable containment scope within the area of logistic sites consists in designing the cable containment infrastructure outside of buildings. The logistic sites part of Bundle 1 and 1.1 are listed in Table 31.

Cable Containment’s scope of work ends 1 meter outside the proposed buildings. All scope beyond that limit will be under the responsibility of the Electrical Design Team and in their corresponding basis of design.
Design Approach Description
9.5Introduction
The redundancy requirements for the project mean that cable containment is required on both sides of the trainway, on the outside of tracks. The general design approach for the cable containment design is to use cable troughs (cable trenches) as the primary choice to host cables. In the eventuality that cable troughs cannot be used due to site or technical restrictions, ductbanks or other solutions may be used. Reinforced concrete ductbanks will also be used for traction power cables and may be used for crossing of underground utilities, railway tracks, roads, etc. Use of multi-ducts would be the preferred approach for track crossings provided that depth of installation is compatible with acceptable ground settlement and sleepers’ displacement.
Bridge crossings shall be done with exposed PVC-coated or epoxy-coated steel conduits, FRE conduits, or covered cable trays as specified by OPSD 2104.010 [8].
Concrete-encased ductbank is the preferred method to run through the tunnels alongside the tracks to comply with NFPA130 requirements.
9.6Cabling Infrastructure
To determine which type of cabling infrastructure works best for a specific application, there are numerous factors to consider. Some factors to consider first are: contractual requirements, maintenance requirements, and site characteristics.
9.6.1Contractual Requirements
The requirements specific to cable containment are contained in the Capital Projects Group Rail Corridor Raceway Requirements [6] produced by Metrolinx and called for in the project agreement for the GO Rail Expansion – On Corridor Project.
9.6.2Maintenance Requirements
Maintenance requirements are defined and developed by the operations and maintenance joint venture (OMJV) and will be complied with during design.
9.6.3Site Characteristics
Cable containment type will be selected to adjust to site characteristics.
Before construction starts, the constructor shall review site conditions and design, evaluate the constructability of the proposed design, and inform the engineering design team of any issue uncovered.
9.7Sizing
For preliminary design purposes, sizing of the required cable containment volume has been done conservatively, based on experience and on a high-level review of the cable routing diagrams produced by E&M during the bid phase ([15] to [23]). As the design evolves and cable lists become available, these will be reviewed to assess the potential for cable containment design optimization.
The size considered for each of the cable troughs is 20 inches wide by 12 inches deep. The internal volume of such cable troughs is ~160 000 mm2, for a total usable volume of ~320 000 mm2 on each side of the tracks.
This is equivalent to about twenty (20) 103 mm diameter conduits per trough.
For the equivalent volume using multi-ducts would require two MULTIductTM 9 Way, each being 15 in. x 15 in. outside dimensions.
9.8Comparison
Once one or several options have been identified as meeting the above requirements, they then can be compared for cost and availability before selecting the solution. The analysis and the selection rationale should be produced jointly with the constructor and documented for future reference. It should be noted that the cable containment type will not be the same everywhere.
Table 33: Comparison Table of Different Infrastructure Type
Infrastructure Type
When/Where to use
Things to consider
Reinforced concrete ductbank
- Where surface obstacles need to be avoided
- Where subject to vehicular loading
- Where subject to ground settlement
- Ensure proper spacers are used to provide intended duct spacing and flexible deformation
- Ensure duct formation matches the access points sidewall openings to avoid having to do ductbank rotations
- Ensure proper concrete coverage around conduits
Direct-buried ducts
- Where no vehicular or ground settlement are expected
- Provide a means of ensuring duct spacing before backfilling
Flexible conduits
- For the last meter connection to an equipment
- To account for structure movement when transitioning on or off a structure
- Do not exceed the cable maximum bending radius
Multi-duct
- Anywhere a concrete ductbank or direct-buried ducts are used
- Ensure depth of burial is adequate for expected loading
- Verify that it can withstand loading required at installation location
When used as UTX, under-sleeper pads are required
Post-installation compaction and ballast tamping is required to prevent settlement and hanging sleepers when installation for UTX
Exposed conduits
- On structures where depth is insufficient for ducts burial and where cable troughs cannot be installed due to insufficient space
- On walls where space is insufficient for other solutions
- Anchoring of supports and brackets
- Expansion joints or flexible conduits are required when transitioning on/off structures
- PVC should not be used in exposed conditions
- For surface run conduits, conduit must be PVC-coated or epoxy-coated galvanized steel 
Cable troughs / trenches
- For long longitudinal runs with little or no surface obstacles (along train tracks outside the track loading area)
- For applications where loading is a concern, use polymer concrete or concrete troughs
- Ensure selected product meets loading requirements (both lateral and vertical)
- Ensure installation requirements from the supplier are considered during design
Cable trays with lids
- On structures where depth is insufficient for cable burial and where cable troughs cannot be installed due to insufficient space
- Where it can easily be supported (under evacuation walkways for example)
- Account for thermal expansion by installing expansion splice plates
- Ensure adequate cable trays structural supports
- Be wary of galvanic corrosion when dissimilar metals are in contact with one another
Direct-buried cables

- The only location this might be used is at interfaces with the electric utility company (Hydro One, Toronto Hydro). However, these interfaces might preferably use underground systems for interconnection
- Inductive coupling for long parallel cable runs
9.9Change Management
The cable containment design approach relies on the pursuit’s initial baseline 3.1 cable routing diagrams produced by E&M [15] to [23]. The interconnections defined in these diagrams will be ported to a Microsoft Access database for baselining and change management. The database will be kept up to date as the project progresses and design evolves. It will constitute cable containment data management system.
Compliance Means to Rail Corridor Raceway Requirements
For detailed information on the requirements, please refer to the document MX-ELEC-RCWY-2018-REV0 [6] from Metrolinx. This section presents the design criteria which will be applied during cable containment design to ensure all requirements are met. To facilitate verification of compliance, this section uses the same structure as the requirements document. However, the headings of some sections or sub-sections which contained only information statements or requirements covering construction activities were intentionally omitted.
In some cases, we consider that optimization of the requirements is possible. Such optimizations are identified by specific markers:

****************************** PROPOSED OPTIMIZATION END *******************************
A description of the proposed optimization along with the associated rationale are presented in each case.
9.10General
9.10.1Cable Separation
The project requirements specify a minimum separation of 610 mm between power and communications systems and that the cables be run in separate raceways.
**************************** PROPOSED OPTIMIZATION START ******************************
For some of the tight cross sections, a 610 mm separation might not be feasible. However, under the clause 5.1.8.2 of the CSA C22.3 No.7 [3], a minimum separation of 300 mm between the power and communication system is permitted in a joint-use trench. A 300 mm separation between the power and communication troughs would be equivalent to this.
If the minimum separation of 300 mm cannot be achieved, the two troughs can be run closer for a parallel distance not exceeding 3 meters.
Description
Electromagnetic susceptibility is dependent on voltage and current. Small power circuits have a lower impact than high power circuits on control cables. The required separation can be refined to account for the type of signal carried by each cable.
Rationale
By categorizing cables into electromagnetic compatibility classes, the required separation between each cable class to ensure adequate mitigation of electromagnetic interference can be determined. For most cable classes, this relaxes the required spacing aiding design in space constrained areas. Conversely, for instances where high voltage cables are present, it is determined that additional spacing is required.
The required spacing can be further reduced if metallic cable trays with or without separators are used, providing electromagnetic shielding.
Table 34 lists the cable susceptibility classes as defined in [11].

****************************** PROPOSED OPTIMIZATION END *******************************
9.11Grounding and Bounding
The grounding and bounding shall be done in coordination with E&M teams and the grounding and bonding discipline.
Refer to the Basis of Design for Grounding and Bonding [12] and to System Design and Construction Rules [11] for details and background information.
9.11.1General
Cathodic protection and grounding will be provided by the grounding and bonding discipline in line with E&M’s requirements.
Pullboxes will be connected to grounding rods and provide grounding points inside.
Concrete-encased ductbanks will be grounded at the pullboxes or buildings they connect to.
Cable trays will be grounded to their supporting structures, themselves grounded.
Any other grounding and bonding requirements from the grounding and bonding team will be implemented in the cable containment design.
9.12Installation on Railway Right-of-Way
9.12.1Loading
Metrolinx requires that any installation within 7.5 m of the centerline of the outermost track shall withstand a minimum Cooper E-80 loading.
9.12.2Longitudinal Installations
General
The design approach for longitudinal installation of cable containment infrastructure is to use two cable troughs on each side (for a total of four (4) cable troughs) of the right of way to provide the redundancy required by the system. One of the troughs on each side is dedicated to power cables and the other is for control and fiber optic cables, separated by a divider. A physical separation between the power and the communications troughs is required to mitigate EMI/EMC effects.
Note that at some specific locations, additional troughs may be used if the volume of cables warrants.
The troughs are installed outside the area reserved for OCS poles. The installation will be coordinated with existing and relocated utilities to ensure the troughs are not installed above.
In addition, the troughs placement will be coordinated with drainage to ensure drainage functions properly and with the tracks team to ensure track stability is unaffected.
Particular situations for which there is insufficient space for the cable troughs (retaining walls, narrow ROW, stations, bridges, etc.) will be handled on a case-by-case basis during detailed design.
**************************** PROPOSED OPTIMIZATION START ******************************
9.12.2.1.1Description
The Metrolinx requirements prescribe that longitudinal installations be clear of the track bed. We suggest making this a target design criterion rather than a hard requirement.
Proposed alternate text: "Longitudinal raceway installations within the track bed shall be avoided as much as practical. When unavoidable, installation design requires a review by tracks designers to ensure impact on track stability and longevity is minimized. Refer to Figure 1: Fill Installation Directional Bore (Appendix A) for preferred installation location.

Figure 4: Typical cross-section with cable containment in track bed structure
9.12.2.1.2Rationale
It is impossible to meet this requirement everywhere given the locations with a narrow ROW, existing underground infrastructure and the fact that trackside equipment requiring connections will lie within the illustrated area.
This optimization will allow reconciling requirements and site conditions to enable designing a practical and constructible design.
****************************** PROPOSED OPTIMIZATION END *******************************
**************************** PROPOSED OPTIMIZATION START ******************************
9.12.2.1.3Description
A 3.5 m wide zone, located 1.5 m away from the centerline of the track, is reserved around OCS poles in the MX requirements. This means that the closest from an OCS foundation that cable containment can be installed is 1.4 m (5 m – 3 m from the centerline of track to center of OCS pole – 0.6 m (half widest expected diameter for OCS foundation)). Proposal is to relax that requirement for space-constrained located to a minimum of 500 mm.
9.12.2.1.4Rationale
500 mm clearance would be sufficient to enable OCS pole foundation construction. Saving 900 mm on both sides or the ROW would help designing in space-constrained locations.
****************************** PROPOSED OPTIMIZATION END *******************************
Track Crossing
The MX Standard [6] has the following requirements with respect to under-track crossings (UTX).
The crossings below the track shall meet the following clearance requirements:
Top of ductbank or pipe casing at least 1.52 m below the base of rail.
Crossing under railways shall be done following geometric criteria’s:
0.6 m beyond the toe of the slope.
2.0 m from the outside rail.
not extending beyond the rail right-of-way.
All under track bores shall be at 90 degrees when using a directional bore. Minimum angle of 60 degrees shall be used.
**************************** PROPOSED OPTIMIZATION START ******************************
9.12.2.1.5Description
Allow the use of multi-ducts to replace casing pipes or individual ducts.
9.12.2.1.6Rationale
Multi-ducts meet E-80 Cooper loading and have been used extensively in Europe. They have been installed in Northern climates such as in Finland and Norway. Installation would require an open trench but short installation times minimize operations disruption.
****************************** PROPOSED OPTIMIZATION END *******************************
Road Crossing
Minimum depth of road crossing is 1.52 m below top of pavement and shall be coordinated with the authorities having jurisdiction.
Where open trench cannot be performed, crossing under roads shall be done in a casing pipe and shall be approved by authorities having jurisdiction. It shall also be done below the frost penetration of 1,200 mm for the GTA area [9].
For open trench, duct bank shall have a minimum of 1.52 m cover depth.
For required separation from other utilities, refer to Section 11.3.2.6.
Bridge Crossing
In the case of new bridges where design is not yet complete, using conduits embedded in the structure will be considered.
In the case of existing bridges, the solution depends on the bridge type. Ducts can be mounted on the surface of structures, using brackets, or hanged under the structure, as shown in OPSD 2104.010 [8].
OPSD 3900.100 [24] shows the preferred location of cable containment for each structure type.
As per the proposed optimization detailed in Section 11.8, the ducts could be replaced by cable trays provided the optimization is acceptable to the authority having jurisdiction.
Expansion boxes and joints will be used as required to account for structure movement (e.g., at structure expansion joints and where transitioning on and off structures). The infrastructure shall allow for a means to provide cable slack during cable installation so that cables can follow structural movement without damage. For this purpose, refer to mandatory access points locations (Table 43).
Oil/Gas Pipeline Crossing
Pipeline crossing shall be coordinated with the National Energy Board and/or the owner in question before entering its ROW. In addition, a minimum separation of 1.0 m is required, or as per utility owner requirements. Coordination with external stakeholders is the responsibility of CJV.
Utility Crossing
Metrolinx requires a 1 m minimum separation between duct and utility, from the outside of the duct. Refer to Utilities discipline Basis of Design [27] when cable containment design crosses third party networks (i.e., Bell, Zayo, CN, etc.).
**************************** PROPOSED OPTIMIZATION START ******************************
The 1.0 m separation might not be achievable in congested areas.
9.12.2.1.7Description
The approach would be to use 1.0 m for horizontal separation as a design target to be met everywhere it is practical. For areas where maintaining 1.0 m horizontal separation is not possible, the maximum achievable separation would be used, never less than 300 mm.
For vertical separation, a minimum of 150 mm would be used.
In all cases, coordination with the utilities companies will take place and their specific requirements will be considered.
9.12.2.1.8Rationale
The proposed values are in line with separation values listed in Table 3 of CSA 22.3 No. 7 [3] and reproduced here for convenience.

9.14Conduits
9.14.1General
The allowable length of a conduit run is driven by the ability to successfully pull cables through it for installation. The two main limiting factors are the cable pulling tension and the maximum sidewall bearing pressure, two cable-dependent values.
Pulling tension is a function of the value of the angles of the elbows used in a run as well as of the cable weight.
Pullboxes will be installed at a maximum of 250 m along a linear route without any bends. This number will get confirmed once the cables are selected and their specifications are known.
Angles
Although the adequacy of each run needs to be validated by a pulling calculation, a general rule to develop the preliminary design is to ensure that the sum of angles of any conduit run does not exceed 270 degrees between two consecutive access points.
Deviating from this is acceptable provided a cable pulling calculation considering the cable characteristics demonstrates that neither the maximum pulling tension nor the maximum sidewall bearing pressure is exceeded. However, a total of 360 degrees shall never be exceeded between two consecutive access points (CEC HB, Rule 12-910). A margin of 10% should be applied when performing the calculation.
Always aim at using the smallest angles which meet the purpose and leverage the inherent conduit flexibility for direction changes which can be done over long lengths. Refer to manufacturer’s specifications for allowable deflection per pipe material and size.
Depending on conduit types and diameters, some conduits can be bent in the field to accommodate arbitrary angles. It is good practice however to use standard angles as much as possible. Care should be taken to double-check commercially available elbow angles prior to designing as their availability sometimes vary depending on the conduit type. If bending is a necessity, refer to the fabricant specification and maximum bend angles prescribed.
Radii
The second factor at play, maximum sidewall bearing pressure, is a function of the elbow radius and of the pulling tension at the entry of the bend.
Table 7 of the Canadian Electrical Code (CSA C22.1-18), reproduced here, lists the minimum radius to be respected depending on size of conduit.
In general, however, it is good practice to use larger radii to ease cable pulling by minimizing sidewall bearing pressure. Standard radii provided by conduit manufacturers always meet and generally exceed the code requirements. Larger radii are also likely to be specified in contractual requirements. When designing, aim for a larger radius when site conditions allow as it will ease cable pulling. If space constraints are present, work your way down from there using the next largest available radius size, never going under the minimum values of the table above. When sidewall pressures are exceeded with the largest radius the site can accommodate, consider adding an intermediate access point.
Note that the elbows have a straight portion (“tangent”) of varying length before and after the bend. It is important to refer to the appropriate data sheet to consider the proper length when designing and modeling.

Sizing
From the Metrolinx requirements, a maximum 30% fill ratio, no matter the number of cables, is specified for this project.
**************************** PROPOSED OPTIMIZATION START ******************************
9.14.1.1.1Description
With regards to conduit size, the maximum conduit fill is specified in the Canadian Electrical Code, in Table 8, where the allowable conduit fill depends on the number of cables to be installed in a particular conduit. Following the requirements of Table 42 would allow optimizing the cable containment size.

9.14.1.1.2Rationale
When the number of cables and their type running inside a conduit is known, the conduit size can be optimized by following the CEC rather than the Metrolinx requirements while still ensuring that cables can be easily installed.
****************************** PROPOSED OPTIMIZATION END *******************************
Drainage
Exposed conduit runs installed in wet locations shall use water-tight joints preventing seepage.
Additionally, the conduits must be sloped away from buildings to avoid water ingress. Water will collect at access points which shall have drainage provisions (see Section B). Design for 0.25% (1:400) slopes or steeper.
Under no circumstances, should there be a low point in a ductbank that would cause water accumulation.
9.14.2Conduit Material Requirements
The projects requirements call for the following types of conduits to be used:
a) PVC Schedule 40, or PVC Schedule 80; or
b) HDPE 80, or HDPE 80 multi-duct; or
c) PVC or epoxy coated rigid galvanized steel; or
d) FRE rigid non-metallic; or
e) liquid-tight flexible metal.
For surface-run conduits, PVC-coated or epoxy-coated rigid galvanized steel shall be used.
**************************** PROPOSED OPTIMIZATION START ******************************
When building concrete-encased ductbanks, DB2 conduits, a standard industry product, compliant with CSA C22.2 No.211.1 would enable cost-savings versus using PVC rigid conduits and offer adequate performance.
****************************** PROPOSED OPTIMIZATION END *******************************
9.15Conductor Pull Access Points
9.15.1General
Access Points Locations
Access points from which cables can be pulled are required periodically for long conduit runs. A cable pulling calculation is necessary to establish the distance between each access point. Limit pulling tension to a point that will not damage cable insulation or deform the cable. A description of maximum permissible pulling forces is given in the Ontario Electrical Safety Code. Access points are also mandatory at the following specific locations:
Table 43: Mandatory Access Points Locations
Location
Access Point Requirement
Rationale
Wayside Equipment
Along the main cable route (usually installed longitudinally with respect to the train tracks) to connect to wayside equipment, level crossings or to a bungalow.
The access point allows for branching and doubles up as an access point for the longitudinal run.
Buildings
An independent access point is required for each ductbank entering a building as well as before and after station platforms.
Provides the interface between the building and the external cabling infrastructure. Easier for cable pulling and avoids coordination challenges potentially exceeding the allowed angles (i.e., angles inside and outside the buildings are decoupled)
Structures
Just before and just after trainway structures (bridges, viaducts, etc.).
These access points allow realizing a clean transition onto and off structures as the cabling infrastructure on the structures are likely to be different (exposed or concealed conduits, cable trays, etc.) and structure dependent.
They are also used as slack pits to account for the effect movement of structures will have on installed cables (expansion and contraction).
9.15.2Manholes, Handholes, Pullboxes
General
For the purpose of this section, the following definitions apply.
Pullbox: Generic term for an access point from which cables can be pulled. Can be either a manhole or a handhole depending on the cable size requirement, the purpose (drainage or cable pulling or both), and site conditions.
Manhole: Modular glass-reinforced plastic or concrete reinforced pullbox of sufficient dimensions for an individual to enter and store coiled cable slack.
Handhole: Smaller pullbox providing an access point to ease cable pulling. Can be either reinforced concrete, polymer concrete or modular glass-reinforced plastic.
Different pullboxes will be used for the different system components (e.g., positive traction power cables, negative traction power cables, low voltage cables and communications).
Factors bearing on the choice of manholes and handholes are number of cables, direction, and location of duct runs; cable racking arrangement; method of drainage; adequacy of workspace (especially if equipment is to be installed in the manhole); and the size of the opening required to install and remove equipment.
Manholes, handholes and pullboxes should be located at least 3.0 m from the edge of the track ties when ROW permits. When space is not sufficient, the minimum distance to consider is 1.0 m provided that track stability is unaffected.
Manholes
9.15.2.1.1Description
Manholes shall be constructed from modular glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) or from precast concrete and satisfy the requirements expressed in Section 11.6.2.2.2. Note that concrete type and strength, as well as chimney height requirements do not apply to modular GRP. All other requirements apply.
In areas where cast-in-place manholes might be needed, the following general requirements shall be respected. Choose the type of manhole based on loading and size requirements and robustness.
9.15.2.1.2General Requirements

Drainage
9.15.2.1.4General
For manholes, there will be no sump pit as per OSPD 2111.040 and OSPD 2111.050. All Manholes shall be drained to the sewer and drainage system and shall depend on sewer outfall elevation:
1.Manholes that can be gravity drained:
a.Drain opening shall be located on the manhole wall, at the invert of the floor.

Sizing of handholes to be determined in accordance with the Canadian Electrical Code.
9.15.3Slack Pit Requirements/Vaults
9.15.4General
If a single pullbox of sufficient volume cannot be installed due to space constraints, slack pits will be considered. When slack pits are required, a standard precast manhole will be used to perform that function.
**************************** PROPOSED OPTIMIZATION START ******************************
Description
Suggest accepting that manholes or pullboxes act as slack pits and pull pits when they are of sufficient size to adequately accommodate cable slack storage.

Large manholes or pullboxes can accommodate cable slack storage reducing the need for slack pits. Slack pits could be used when manholes or pullboxes are not of sufficient size to accommodate cable slack storage resulting in space and cost savings.

9.16Duct Banks
9.16.1General
Direct-Buried Conduits Ductbanks
Direct-buried conduits ductbanks will be designed according to OPSD 2101.01 [13].
As per MX-ELEC-RCWY-2018-REV0 [6], direct-buried conduits ductbanks shall not be used for traction power cables.
If the total number of conduits, or if conduit size is not specified in the table of OPSD 2101.01 [13], concrete encased ductbanks as described in Section 11.7.1.3 shall be used.
Multi-Ducts
Multi-ducts are HDPE modules designed to host cables which have been used in the UK by Network Rail for under-track crossings. Figure 5 shows a picture of multi-ducts of various sizes. An assessment is currently underway to determine if multi-ducts installations in the context of OnCorr would meet the requirements, notably the required E-80 Cooper loading. The review of track behavior by the tracks discipline is also required to confirm acceptable depth of installation of the multi-duct and its potential effects on track stability (settlement, sleeper displacement, etc.). If all requirements are met, multi-ducts may be used in the design.

Figure 5 – Multi -Ducts
Concrete Encased Ductbanks
Ductbanks will be reinforced concrete encased. Rebar will be 20M and center-to-center conduit spacing will be 190mm as per the Canadian Electrical Code, as per OPSD 2100.06.

Figure 6: Typical Reinforced Concrete Encased Ductbank Cross-section
Conduit spacers will be used in the duct bank and maintain a minimum spacing of 190 mm between conduits.
A warning tape of minimum width of 304 mm will be provided above all ductbanks, placed 500 mm below surface.
All conduits in duct banks shall have pull cords installed along the entire length, initiating from a pullbox and terminating at the duct banks end.
Conduits shall be terminated using a bell end at pullboxes and where entering a building.
9.16.2Minimum Number of Mainline Conduits Including Spares
Minimum Number of Mainline Conduits
The minimum number of conduits running on both sides of the tracks will be determined from E&M’s needs as expressed in the cable routing diagrams ([14] to [23]) and as they evolve. 30% spares will be considered along with additional provisions for riskier areas.
**************************** PROPOSED OPTIMIZATION START ******************************
Description
The Metrolinx Raceways Standard [6] prescribes a colour-code for conduits. Suggest not applying this requirement.
Rationale
Conduits identification at the manholes will serve the same purpose. This optimisation would result in cost savings and facilitate procurement of conduits.
****************************** PROPOSED OPTIMIZATION END *******************************
Conduits Spares
It is unlikely that the final cable list will be available when design of the cable containment infrastructure begins. Extra care needs to be taken in providing enough reserve conduits to ensure that the inevitable addition of cables will still allow meeting the maximum fill threshold for all conduits. Use the guide below to provide a minimum of 30% spares as per the project’s requirements [6].

9.16.3Traction Power and High Voltage Raceway
Traction power raceways will be concrete reinforced ductbanks as described in the previous section with conduit size dimensioned to meet fill ratio of 30% with 2 cables per conduit.
Conduits will be Schedule 80 PVC conduits or FRE conduits for straight portions and use PVC-coated or epoxy-coated rigid galvanized steel conduit elbows.
**************************** PROPOSED OPTIMIZATION START ******************************
Description
Reduce required radius to 5 feet. This is the maximum standard commercially available PVC-coated steel conduits radius (5 feet, 1.524 m).
Allow the use of PVC elbows with PVC conduits provided that it can be demonstrated that maximum sidewall pressure during cable pulling is not exceeded.
Rationale
1.8 m radius conduits are not available for PVC-coated steel.
A custom radius conduit would need to be produced.
Such a radius is not required given the cables specifications which can accommodate a smaller bend radius.
Sidewall pressure during cable pulling can be calculated to ensure burn through is avoided even when using PVC elbows.
****************************** PROPOSED OPTIMIZATION END *******************************
9.17Cable Tray
In the Metrolinx raceway requirements, the use of cable tray is restricted to radio towers, where ventilated trays and covers may be used.
Cable trays and supports will be designed to provide adequate strength to support the weight of the cables and future cables, minimum load Class E, complete with stainless steel hardware, extra heavy duty. Covers will be used.
******************************** PROPOSED OPTIMIZATION START ******************************
Description
Allowing the use of cable trays on bridges and viaducts and in the corridor as an alternate allowed design approach would provide an additional technical solution for areas of limited space.
Rationale
There will be instances when using exposed conduits does not allow meeting required usable volume or site space requirements. Cable trays for exterior use have been used successfully on numerous transit projects, provide for easier cable installation and are a definite option for tight areas.
****************************** PROPOSED OPTIMIZATION END *******************************
9.18Cable Trough
A comparative analysis of the main types of cable troughs is presented herein.
Considering this analysis, the polymer concrete troughs offer the best compromise. The HDPE troughs do not meet several requirements, notably the loading capacity and the resistance to lateral forces.

9.19Raceways at Passenger Stations
Manholes and handholes must be located at every end of the platform and along the platform at the entrance of a tunnel, bridge, shelter, and outside pedestrian traffic areas to grant junction points for the communication and power conductors.
The cable containment inside the station or outside the platform is the responsibility of the Electrical Design Team. The manholes will constitute the preferred design interface point between the two disciplines. There might be instances with the interface where it must be adjusted depending on site conditions or existing buildings layout. Those adjustments will require the Line station Basis of Design.
9.20Pedestrian Tunnels
Pedestrian tunnels are outside the scope of the cable containment discipline. Refer to the electrical discipline.
9.21Marker Posts and Tie Plate Markers, Warning Decals
9.21.1Marker Posts
The crossings will be suitably identified with markers located on each side of the railway tracks and roadway.
9.21.2Tie Plates
Tie plates will be used where raceway/cables pass underneath the track or is within the raceway/cable crosses multiple tracks. In addition, they will be placed on the main track tie and the siding tie so the markers are on either side of the cable where available and if not replaced by concrete ties.
9.21.3Warning Decals
The warning decals is sized to be 75 mm x 240 mm, with white background and black letters stating, “warning of buried cable” and the appropriate contact information before digging and excavation.

As-built drawings will be provided by the Constructor. As such, their production is not part of the cable containment discipline scope.


9.23Summary of Proposed Optimizations
Table 47 summarizes the proposed optimization and its rationale.
Table 47: Design Optimization Table
Metrolinx Paragraph Number
Metrolinx Requirements
Related Section
Proposed Optimization
Rationale
Benefit
2.1.4
Power and communications (control and data) systems shall be run in separate raceways and set a minimum of 610 mm apart.
11.1.1
Use separation according to cable susceptibility classes as defined in RER3-EM-SYS-SPN-ALL-00003 [11].
Susceptibility is dependent on voltage and current. Small power circuits have a lower impact than high power circuits on control cables.
Separation could be reduced to 300 mm resulting in a space saving of 620 mm for the required width of overall cable containment.
3.2.1 (1)
The minimum allowable distance from the raceway to the centerline of track shall be per Figure 1: Fill Installation Directional Bore (Appendix A).
11.3.2.1
Suggest making this a target design criteria rather than a hard requirement. Proposed alternate text: "Longitudinal raceway installations within the track bed shall be avoided as much as practical. When unavoidable, installation design requires a review by tracks designers to ensure impact on track stability and longevity is minimized. Refer to Figure 1: Fill Installation Directional Bore (Appendix A) for preferred installation location.
Impossible to meet this requirement everywhere given the ROW, existing underground infrastructure, and the fact that trackside equipment requiring connections will lie within the illustrated area. 
In addition, transverse cable routes will be required periodically to ensure system redundancy.
Allows reconciling requirements and site conditions to enable designing a practical and constructible design.
3.2.1 (7)
Figure 6: Typical OCS Pole (Appendix A) shows a reserved 3.5 m wide zone, located 1.5 m away from the centerline of the track, around OCS poles
11.3.2.1
A 3.5 m wide zone, located 1.5 m away from the centerline of the track, is reserved around OCS poles in the MX requirements. This means that the closest from an OCS foundation that cable containment can be installed is 1.4 m (5 m – 3 m from the centerline of track to center of OCS pole – 0.6 m (half widest expected diameter for OCS foundation)). Proposal is to relax that requirement for space-constrained located to a minimum of 500 mm.
500 mm clearance would be sufficient to enable OCS pole foundation construction. Saving 900 mm on both sides of the ROW would help designing in space-constrained locations
1.8 m narrower ROW required.
3.2.2 (2)
Crossing under rail tracks shall be done in casing pipe or duct bank:
a) not less than 1.52 m from base of rail to top of casing at its closest point:
b) of a size sufficient to allow for the removal of the cable without disturbing the casing pipe or road bed
c) Extending 600 mm beyond the toe of the slope of the roadbed
d) 1.0 m beyond the ditch;
11.3.2.2
Allow the use of multi-ducts to replace casing pipes or individual ducts.
Multi-ducts can sustain adequate loading and have been used extensively in Europe.
Shorter installation times and less operations disruption.
3.2.6 (2)
Minimum separation between duct and utility shall be 1.0m from the outside of the duct.
11.3.2.6
1 m for horizontal separation as a design target. If not possible, max practical separation, never less than 300 mm
150 mm for vertical separation between ductbanks and other underground systems
Clarify that this applies for horizontal separation of parallel infrastructures. We need to define the minimum clearance between utilities and raceways when they are crossing (vertical separation). Suggest using 150 mm as per CSA C22,3 No. 7, paragraph 6.2.1.2.
Allows reconciling requirements and site conditions to enable designing a practical and constructible design.
3.4.1 (3)
Conduits fill shall not exceed 30%. 
11.5.1.3
Following the requirements of Table 8 of the Canadian Electrical Code would allow optimizing the cable containment size.
When the number of cables and their type running inside a conduit is known, the conduit size can be optimized by following the CEC rather than the Metrolinx requirements while still ensuring that cables can be easily installed.
Reduction of the number of conduits required.
3.4.2 (1)
Conduits shall be:
a) PVC Schedule 40, or PVC Schedule 80; or
b) HDPE 80, or HDPE 80 multi-duct; or
c) PVC or epoxy coated rigid galvanized steel; or
d) FRE rigid non-metallic; or
e) liquid-tight flexible metal.
11.5.2
Proposal to add DB2 conduits (compliant to CSA C22.2 No.211.1) for concrete-encased ductbanks.
Standard industry product.
CSA approved (C22.2 No. 211.1)
The type of conduit in the ductbank has a negligible impact on meeting the E-80 Cooper loading. The supported loading is related to the ductbank construction, namely concrete and rebar types.
Cost-savings vs rigid PVC conduits.
3.4.2 (3)
On bridges and other structures, exposed raceways shall be PVC or epoxy coated rigid galvanized steel conduit (RGSC), complete with expansion deflection assemblies, see Ministry of Transportation drawings MTOD-2930.070, MTOD-2930.060. If raceways are concealed in concrete as an integral part of a bridge or overpass, Schedule 40 PVC conduit may be used.
11.5.2
As per previous proposal, allow DB2 conduits for concrete encased applications as an integral part of a bridge or overpass.
Standard industry product. 

CSA approved (C22.2 No. 211.1)
Cost-savings vs rigid PVC conduits.
3.5.3 (1)
Vault/slack storage pits shall be provided for cable slack storage in electrical chamber (usually the last 3.0m from handhole/manhole into bungalows/cases to equipment, tunnels, bridges, road and track crossing, culverts, ends of station platforms, per detail design) where the cables are usually coiled near cable ends.
11.6.4
Suggest accepting that manholes or pullboxes act as slack pits and pull pits when they are of sufficient size to adequately accommodate cable slack storage.
Large manholes or pullboxes can accommodate cable slack storage reducing the need for slack pits. Slack pits to be used when pullbox is not of sufficient size to accommodate cable slack storage.
Space and cost savings.
3.6.2 (1)
Power Raceways:
a) Provide a minimum of 4 x 100mm (4 in), red color conduit and red color with different strips for easy identification (2 Signaling, 2 Electrification).
11.7.2
Do not apply this requirement.
Conduits identification at the manholes will serve the same purpose.

Better conduits availability.
3.6.2 (2)
Communication Raceways:

a) Provide a minimum of 6 x 53 mm, orange color, for Fiber Optic Systems.
b) Provide a minimum of 2 x 53 mm, purple color, for Corporate Network, Operation/Station, Leasing, and Communications System.
c) Provide a minimum of 1 x 53 mm, brown color, for Radio System.
11.7.2
Do not apply this requirement.
Conduits identification at the manholes will serve the same purpose.
Cost savings.

Better conduits availability.
3.6.2 (4)
A minimum of 610 mm separation shall be provided between power and communications.
See proposed optimization for paragraph 2.1.4.
 
 
 
3.6.3 (1)
Duct banks initiating from facilities to the first manhole outside of the alignment and to all subsequent manholes and feeder poles within the alignment, shall be Schedule 80 PVC conduit, FRE conduit, with PVC or epoxy coated rigid galvanized steel conduit elbows, with a radius greater than 1.8m, encased in steel-reinforced concrete.
11.7.3
Reduce required radius to 5 feet. This is the maximum standard commercially available PVC-coated steel conduits radius (5 ft, 1.524 m).
Allow the use of PVC elbows provided that it can be demonstrated that maximum sidewall pressure during cable pulling is not exceeded.
1.8m radius conduits are not available for PVC-coated steel.
A custom radius conduit would need to be produced.
Such a radius is not required given the cables specifications which can accommodate a smaller bend radius.
Sidewall pressure during cable pulling can be calculated to ensure burn through is avoided even when using PVC elbows.
Cost savings
3.7.1
Design circumstances may require physical protection of the cables, in which case ventilated cable trays and covers may be used. Cable trays use is restricted to radio towers between bunker and tower within system buildings, across pedestrian bridges and rooms (i.e., bungalows, bunkers, electrical and control rooms). Cable trays and supports shall be designed to provide adequate strength to support the weight of the cables and future cables, minimum load Class E, complete with stainless steel hardware, extra heavy duty.
11.8
Allowing the use of cable trays on bridges and viaducts and in the corridor as an alternate allowed design approach would provide an additional technical solution for areas of limited space. 
There might be instances when using exposed conduits does not allow meeting required usable volume or site space requirements.

Cable trays for exterior use have been used successfully on numerous transit projects, provide for easier cable installation and are a definite option for tight areas.
Easier cable installation.

Option for tight areas.

10.Additional Design Criteria
10.1Geo-Engineering
The geo-engineering design criteria are provided within the program-wide Geo-engineering Basis of Design [30] currently under development and provided under separate cover.
This document will include the design principles and assumptions to be implemented in the approach to geotechnical, hydrogeological, and geo-environmental (excess soils and groundwater) design, as well as pavement and materials design for the program, herein referred to as geo-engineering.
10.2Fire-Resistance Design
A fire barrier (e.g., fire-resistant putty) shall be used to seal the space around the cables in conduits entering a building and prevent fire propagation.
Cable containment in enclosed trainways shall meet NFPA 130 [5] Section 12 requirements.
To achieve that, the cable containment infrastructure for emergency power and emergency communications will make use of redundant and independent ductbanks embedded in at least 100mm of concrete to provide a 1-hour fire-resistance.
For space-constrained locations where achieving this is impossible, incombustible cable containment with fire-resistant cables shall be used.
An alternate solution to allow using standard cabling would be to use endothermic mats to protect the incombustible cable containment. Hilti and 3M are suppliers of endothermic mats. However, this solution is a last resort and should only be used for short lengths. It expensive, requires more work to put in place and installation quality is critical to adequate fire-resistance.
10.3Design Life Span
The minimum design life for the signalling system is 30 years, communications system 20 years, SCADA system 30 years and traction power equipment 40 years. (Project Agreement, Schedule C-6, Section A.3.5).
A minimum design life span of 30 years for general cable containment and of 40 years for cable containment hosting traction power cables is thus considered.
10.4Clearances from Power Lines
All system components shall be maintained at a minimum clearance as shown in Table 48.

10.5Interface with Existing Line Stations
Assemblies are not part of the cable containment design and shall be looked after by the electrical design team. An interface might still exist when a cable transitions from a ductbank to an electrical room inside a station for example. In this case, the end assembly would be the destination electrical panel in the electrical room, as defined by the station electrical discipline.
Refer to the Basis of Design for existing stations [12].
10.6Passive Protection within USRC
Cable containment will not be installed in the ballast, sub ballast and sub grade levels in the following areas:
Between MP 0.40 and 0.55:
A. south of the existing Oakville-Kingston south connector track;
B. between existing tracks C1 and A3; and
C. north of existing track B.
North of existing track BNY1 between MP 0.7 and MP 0.75 where the existing Bathurst North Layover Facilities Substation and Bathurst North Layover Facilities Crew Center are currently located inclusive of all ancillary spaces and staff parking.
Where Spadina station will be constructed as defined in section C13 of the project agreement.
The exact type of cable containment will be selected according to specific site conditions and depends on the reusability of the legacy cable containment already in place. When cable containment cannot avoid the afore-mentioned areas, to meet the requirement to relocate new cables within a 7-day window, exposed conduits, or cable trays, installed on existing structures or walls or installed on racks not requiring foundations are envisioned.
