ABSTRACT
This thesis presents work in the development of computational descriptions of Gehry’s
architectural forms. In Gehry’s process for realizing buildings, computation serves as an
intermediary agent for the integration of design intent with the geometric logics of fabrication
and construction. This agenda for digital representation of both formal and operational
intentions, in the context of an ongoing exploration of challenging geometries, has provided
new roles for computation in architectural practice.

The work described in this thesis focuses on the digital representation of surface geometry
and its capacity for describing the constructibility of building enclosure systems. A particular
class of paper surface forms – curved surfaces with minimal in plane deformation of the
surface material – provide the specific object of inquiry for exploring the relationships
between form, geometry and constructibility.

An analysis and framework for the description of Gehry’s geometry is developed through
existing theory of differential geometry and topology. Geometric rules of constructibility
associated with several enclosure system strategies are presented in this framework. With
this theoretical framework in place, the discussion turns to efforts to develop generative
strategies for the rationalization of surface forms into constructible configurations.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
A work of this nature owes a heavy debt of gratitude to many persons. During the time that
this thesis has been prepared, it has been my rare privilege to work closely with a number of
enormously talented individuals, both members of Gehry’s firm as well as those of
associated engineering, construction and fabrication organizations. The products of their
efforts are often referenced in this work, and the inspiration for this inquiry would not have
occurred without their influence. In the interest of brevity, I can unfortunately only mention a
few of their names.


The first and foremost debt of gratitude is owed to Frank Gehry himself. His design vision
and exploratory energy have fostered the community of talent and ideas in which the work
described in this document has occurred. The efforts to realize his design ambitions have
resulted in a context of architectural and building practice for which there is perhaps no
equivalent at this point of writing. Furthermore, his commitment to the achievement of these
design intentions have translated into a support of computational efforts beyond that of his
contemporaries, and have provided the environment for computational inquiry in which the
work described in this document has taken place.


Jim Glymph has served as a mentor and inspiration on all matters architectural and
computational during my time with the firm. The description of a reconstructed architectural
practice presented in Part 1 of this document is largely attributable to many hours of formal
and informal discussions with this visionary practitioner.


The opportunity to apply this research to the firm’s projects has occurred through close
collaboration with the senior designers and project architects on these projects. I gratefully
acknowledge Partner Randy Jefferson, Project Designers Craig Webb and Edwin Chan, and
Project Architects Terry Bell (Disney Concert Hall), Marc Salette (MIT Stata Center), George
Metzger and Larry Tighe (Experience Music Project), Gerhard Mayer (Weatherhead) and
Michal Sedlacek (Museum of Tolerance), for their support and willingness to accommodate
these research efforts on their projects.


The firm’s computational methodologies are similarly the product of many persons’ efforts.

projects is extensively referenced in this document, while the efforts of Reg Prentice and
Cristiano Ceccato in the computing group have profoundly contributed to the development of
the firm’s computational practice. David Bonner of Dassault Systèmes Research and
Development and John Weatherwax from Department of Mathematics at MIT assisted
substantially in the formulation of the material simulation model described in Chapter VII.


On the academic front, I would like to thank the members of my Doctoral Committee, for their
guidance and support of what has become a circuitous path to the completion of this thesis.


Finally, I thank the Reader, for taking the time and interest to review the thoughts contained
herein.

FOREWORD

Over the past decade, Gehry’s firm has developed a unique and innovative approach to the
process of delivering complex building projects. Computer based project information plays a
vital and integral role in enabling this process. The concepts and strategies that have
emerged though the development of the firm’s methodologies offer profound lessons for the
design community, not simply in the ways that computing may be applied to architectural
practice, but in the ways by which computing methods can change the process of building. It
is with an eye to providing further insight into this important example of computing and
practice that this thesis has been prepared.


This thesis offers a view into Gehry Partner’s computer aided design methodologies, based
on the author’s experiences with the firm over the past half decade. Rather than attempting
to tell this story in a historical or encyclopedic fashion, this thesis takes as its object of inquiry
a specific set of building intentions, and associated computational strategies, playing a
fundamental role in the firm’s work: the design, engineering and fabrication of surface forms
on Gehry’s projects. This set of issues is explored as a topic of substantial interest in its own
right, while serving as an example of the larger sets of intentions exhibited by the firm’s
practice.


The qualities of materials and the role of craftsmanship as guiding intentions of Gehry’s work
have received considerable discussion41. These intentions have critical counterparts in
project documentation and construction activities, and in associated computational
constructs. The goal of adequately representing intentions of materiality and craft in digital
form is perhaps the most important and complex aspect of the firm’s computing efforts.
These intentions are fundamental motivations of the firm’s approach to digital representation
of the geometry of project forms, and of the fabrication processes responsible for their
realization. These are central themes of this thesis.


This body of this text is organized into three parts. Part 1 offers an introduction to the role of
computing in Gehry’s design and building delivery process. Computing is explored in its
relationship to key project design, analysis and construction intentions. Important concepts
guiding the development of the firm’s computing efforts are presented, including the nature of
geometric representations employed by the firm, and the role of analytically driven operations


                                                                                                   19
on project geometry. A set of materially guided intentions fundamental to the generation of
Gehry’s surface forms are introduced.       Examples and case studies are provided that
demonstrate the application of these tenets on recent projects. This introductory section
establishes the framework for the inquiry developed in the remainder of the text.


Part 2 focuses on developing a formal representation of materially guided surface forms. This
section describes the firm’s efforts to develop digital counterparts to the behavior of surface
materials in modeling and fabrication. A review of the theory of topology and manifolds
underlying representations of curved spatial objects is presented in Chapter V, followed by a
rigorous formal exploration of the geometric structures employed by the firm and their
applications to specific constructibility problems. A promising new approach to the
representation of surfaces through physical modeling of material behaviors is presented in
detail in Chapter VII. This Part establishes a unified geometric framework for the modeling,
simulation and analysis of the elementary shape elements employed in the firm’s designs.


Part 3 expands on this geometrical framework, in developing a formal methodology for
considering assemblies of these basic surface elements. This extended framework has
implications for the digital representation of project scale gestures, as well as utility for
addressing localized surfacing system fabrication and assembly requirements. With a formal
framework for the representation of surface organizations established, the discussion turns to
operations on these assemblies. The potential is demonstrated for automaton of key
processes addressing constructibility requirements of building systems. Several examples of
these generative approaches to the design of surface systems are documented. The thesis
concludes by presenting a computational framework for the generation of materially guided
surface assemblies.

I. INTRODUCTION

It seems that Gehry’s practice has become synonymous with cutting edge computing
technology and CAD / CAM manufacturing processes. But the path to the firm’s prominence
in architectural computing applications has not been easy or straight forward. Gehry himself
remains skeptical of computing as a tool for design96. He speaks with a certain degree of
pride in his inability to operate a computer, and suggests that the quality of the digital image
is dangerous and subversive to the designer’s eye.


Gehry’s design process is perhaps best characterized by its emphasis on physical objects as
the principal artifacts on which design takes place. The firm places a unique emphasis on the
development of designs through physical models, full scale mockups and other physical
artifacts as the means for understanding and developing design intentions. These artifacts of
include numerous sketch models, some undergoing active transformation while others wait
on shelves or in storage, documented in photos, serving as records of design intentions at
significant points in the process. These models are often deliberately developed to a rough,
unfinished state, in order to allow suggestion of new directions of development as the
designers contemplate the objects. The power of this design process springs in part from the
ambiguity presented by this multiplicity of physical design representations.


These evocative qualities of the firm’s designs persist in the further development of projects
as they enter documentation and construction phases. Project engineering and detailing
strategies are often developed that accommodate the real world indeterminacy of on-site
construction events. Many building system strategies have involved in-situ fabrication and
placement of system elements as a means for responding to on-site conditions. This reliance
on the efforts of craftsmen, operating in the field, again reflects the profound concern for
physical artifacts and events as driving elements of the design process and the aesthetic that
results.


The role of computer-based methodologies in this fundamentally tactile, evocative process
presents a dilemma. Contemporary CAD modeling capabilities seem to stand in marked
contrast to these design intentions. CAD modeling strips away ambiguity, producing definitive
geometric forms that “leave little to the imagination”. These digital, logically founded


                                                                                             23
constructs stand in curious contrast to the indeterminacy of physical based activities and
artifacts.


The physical / digital interactions, and the tension between these realms of the process have
become fundamental to the success of the firm’s design process. At the heart of the process
is an ongoing affinity between a disparate set of design intentions, embodied in multiple
physical representations, and a coherent set of computer based representations. The
process utilizes the definitiveness computer representations at points in the process where it
is appropriate, and draws these digital descriptions into the assemblage of representations.
The computer based description represents the glue that ties the physical design
representations    together,   and    ultimately   document    their   convergence.    Computer
representations allow the intentions embodied in multiple physical representations to be
resolved, translations of scale to be performed, and incursion of system fabrication decisions
to be resolved into the design intent.


Three dimensional computer aided design applications provide a critical characteristic
relative to traditional building documentation, in the ability to translate design intentions from
physical design artifacts to constructed objects without recourse to two-dimensional
representations. On more “conventional” building projects, this direct translation is
unnecessary and perhaps inefficient. Conventional two dimensional architectural documents,
comprised of plans, sections, elevations and details, compress the full spatial and
dimensional scope of a design into a set of inter-related representations. The regularity of an
object whose dimensions may vary little or not at all from floor to floor can be efficiently
described by a single floor plan background, repeated for each floor. Variations in fit out can
be overlaid on this normalizing representation. Typical details may be specified as a single
detailed drawing. Its application across the project is specified by annotation on floor plans or
sections, or in specifications. For buildings with repetitive components, and regular floor
plans, the necessity for individually describing each element as a three dimensional model
correctly positioned in space would require substantial additional labor. The ability to
mentally resolve multiple two-dimensional representations of a design into a coherent
understanding of the three dimensional object and its methods of construction is a core part
of traditional architectural training and heritage. Architects take a professional pride in the
development of this mental ability.


                                                                                               24
The relationships between tools, process of making enabled by tools, and the objects
produced by operating tools are subtle and deep. The operations enabled by a chosen tool
guide the operator to make specific types of objects or products that the tool affords. The
parallel rule and triangle, blue print and tracing paper overlay of conventional document
production facilitated the design of orthogonally organized building designs. The compass
allows circular arcs to be included in these compositions. When two-dimensional plans are
extruded perpendicularly to the plane of the paper in a uniform fashion, a single drawing
presents a slice through the designed objects whose applicability is invariant of where the cut
is taken. The two dimensional drawing construction provides tremendous expressive power
in describing this geometric regularity. In turn, the designer is subtly guided toward the
development of designs for which the utility of this geometric construct holds. More elaborate
geometries than simple extruded form are of course possible, by combining multiple sections
either in parallel or orthogonally, but the “trace” of the tool is inevitably felt in the resulting
designs.


The adoption of the tools of two-dimensional representation has provided a basis for the
development of descriptive conventions unifying the building industries. This shared
language has Euclidean geometric forms and their sectional representations as an
underlying construct. Straight lines stand in for wall and floor planes, arcs represent
cylindrical forms. Parallel bold lines represent vertical walls, dashed lines represent overhead
elements, usually aligned with elements on a floor plan cut at a higher elevation. This
common understanding among participants in a building project is so deeply shared that it
eludes dissection. An architect and contactor can discuss the layout and construction of a
building on the basis of a two dimensional floor plan without any discussion of what the
elements in the drawing mean. In parallel with the development of this common language of
Euclidean elements, numerous interwoven industries and industrial processes have been
developed around the making of Euclidean objects and building components. Saw mills turn
trees into straight lumber of square profile and flat, rectangular sheets of plywood, steel mills
extrude molten steel into linear members with invariant profiles. Carpenters use plumb bobs,
string, levels and 3:4:5 triangle measurements to produce straight, vertical walls and their
perpendiculars. So pervasive has the “tyranny” of Euclidean geometry become in the building
industries that any building designed without strict accordance to its rules is subject to
characterization as impossible to build.


                                                                                                25
In Gehry’s design process, physical model making is the principal design tool. This primacy
of the construction of physical objects as the vehicle for design explorations in itself propels
the firm’s work beyond the constraints of the Euclidean rationale. In its place, a new set of
guiding rules have been developed, directly related to the materials and operations available
to the processes of object making. Viewed in isolation, the operations of physical modeling
are insufficient to guarantee the constructibility of the full scale products that models are
intended to represent. However, in Gehry’s process, models serve not simply to describe the
object in scale. Rather, the processes and materials of model making are brought into
alignment with, and stand in for, those of craftsmen and fabricators on the resulting building
construction. Materials and construction strategies are selected to emulate aspects of their
full scale counterparts. This approach binds the operations of design directly to those of
building, bypassing the filter of a common language of Euclidean geometry.


Prior to the firm’s adoption of computing based practices, the firm’s process suffered a key
limitation in its methods of project documentation. While the firm could reasonably guarantee
that the designs could be fabricated, the designs still required rendition into conventional two-
dimensional description to support steps of the conventional construction process, including
building permit submissions, bidding and on-site project layout. In order to bring the design
back into the language of building industry convention, two dimensional plans, sections and
elevations needed to be developed. Often, the forms of the models would require re-
interpretation into conventional Euclidean forms of planes, cylinders and cones, simply to be
consistently described through plans and sections.


Even with this painstaking development of project documentation, the geometry was still
beyond the norms of conventional construction description. While fabricators could build the
shapes, the process of bidding and coordinating the projects presented difficulty to
construction managers. Accuracy of quantity takeoffs could not be guaranteed using
conventional methods of measuring off of plans. Shop drawings – necessary for describing
the detailed fabrication geometry – were difficult to render into orthogonal views. Spatial
coordination of building elements became unmanageable as component details were
developed. The limitations of understanding the project geometry through the lens of two
dimensional views exacerbated perceptions of project complexity.




                                                                                              26
The history of the development of computer assisted building delivery by the firm in response
to these limitations has been well documented52. Jim Glymph joined Gehry’s firm in 1989.
Glymph had substantial experience in the role of Executive Architect on several substantially
complex building projects, including the San Diego and Los Angeles Convention Centers. At
the time, 3D CAD was beginning to have application to architectural visualization, movie
animation and automotive and aerospace design. Glymph realized that these technologies
could be applied to the processes of architectural documentation, independent of the
contemporary interest in the technology as a means for project visualization.

Initial forays into the technology were tentatively
undertaken. The firm selected the Barcelona Fish
sculpture – part of the Vila Olimpica project as an
initial test of the approach. The fish sculpture – a
50 meter long sculpture of woven stainless steel
mesh on a structural steel frame – provided a
relatively safe test case for the use of digital
representation as a vehicle for construction
documentation. As a sculpture, with minimal life
safety or building system issues, only the
geometry of the project and the elements of
fabrication needed to be represented digitally.
Code compliance documentation requirements
were minimal compared to that required for an
inhabitable structure.


The development of the surface mesh geometry
presented substantial concern for the design
team. The mesh was understood to have a                Figure I-1: Barcelona fish, physical and
                                                             digital construction models.
resistance to forming in an arbitrarily curved
fashion, and would buckle undesirably if certain constraints on the surface form were
adhered to. Additionally, templates for cutting the shape of the mesh elements needed to be
provided.




                                                                                                  27
Glymph contacted William J. Mitchell, then Professor of Architecture at the Harvard Graduate
School of Design, who produced an initial model of the design in the Alias software package
with graduate student Evan Smythe. While the results of the study demonstrated the
possibility of representing construction documentation in digital form, a critical limitation
emerged in the Alias software’s underlying representation of surfaces. Alias represented the
surface of the sculpture through a tessellation of triangular faces. While this representation
was sufficient to provide visual fidelity to Gehry’s initial physical model, geometric operations
on the surface required to produce the structural steel model were problematic. The
sculpture’s skeleton is constructed as a set of planar, vaulted truss “ribs”, offset from the
surface, and connected to a cross braced structural steel skeleton. Intersections of the rib
planes with the tessellated surface resulted in segmented polylines. It was difficult to control
the segmentation of the mesh surface produced by Alias to correctly produce the required
segmentation of the steel trusses. Offsetting of curves to produce the bottom chord of the
trusses and other geometric operations produced similar undesirable linearization of the
geometry.


Realizing that this segmentation of smooth surfaces would be a critical limitation to its digital
construction documentation process, the firm began to search for more advanced
representational capabilities in other software packages. At the time, the CATIA software
package was one of the few CAD platforms offering true smooth surface representations.
CATIA – initially developed by Dassault Aviation as an in house CAD application for the
development of the Mirage fighter plane – had recently been released as a commercial
application through IBM and was gaining acceptance by the automotive and aerospace
industries. At the time CATIA Version 3 had achieved a commercially viable CAD application
based on Bézier curve and surface algorithms28.


As an engineering tool, CATIA also offered capabilities for surface analysis not provided by
Alias. While unable to provide a detailed assessment of the mesh behavior, capabilities for
analyzing surface curvature were supported. Additionally, CATIA allowed curved surfaces to
be flattened into shapes allowing a reasonable approximation of the mesh profiles required to
cover the surface. These utilities, while representing quite loose approximations of the true
mesh behavior, were sufficiently powerful to support the design and detailing of the mesh
surface.


                                                                                              28
Rick Smith – proprietor of the consulting company C-Cubed - was at the time an independent
IBM business partner, providing CATIA services to the southern California aerospace
industries. Smith revisited the digital modeling of the fish, demonstrating the possibility of
accurately creating the curved geometry of the surface and the construction of the structural
steel geometry as offsets and intersections derived from the curved surface model.
Construction of the sculpture was awarded to Permasteelisa, an Italian curtain wall
fabrication company, for what would be the first of many successful collaborations between
the two firms. Smith brought his model and CATIA station to Italy and worked directly with
the Permasteelisa’s engineers and fabricators to produce the shop drawings for the steel and
layouts for the mesh elements.


Glymph characterizes the experiences of the Barcelona Fish project as a breakthrough in
many ways. The fact that the project, with its admitted geometric complexity, was completed
on time and on budget, while the conventional steel construction of the rest of the Pavilion
complex was suffering construction delays and on site reworking of steel elements “showed
that [the firm] was onto something” in identifying a new process for project documentation.
Furthermore, the direct collaboration with Permasteelisa on the development of shop
drawings - with the endorsement of the project owner - circumvented the conventional
disassociation between architect and fabricator.


At the same time as initial experiments in digital project description were being conducted by
the firm, Dassault Systèmes, the developers of CATIA, were developing a comprehensive
methodology to support the design of Boeing’s 777 aircraft line. Dassault termed this
methodology Digital Mockup (DMU), with the intent to support design, detailing and CNC
fabrication of the 777 aircraft and all components in an integrated, paperless fashion. This
development effort resulted in software functionality within the CATIA product line beyond the
limited functionality of curved surface description that Gehry’s firm had initially sought. The
story of these developments in the digital design of manufactured products presents a
parallel history to Gehry Partners’ efforts in developing similar methodologies for the support
of building projects, and served as an important example closely observed by the firm. The
parallel development of these manufacturing methodologies has also disclosed important
differences in economies and supply chain organization between “vertically integrated”
industries such as the aerospace industry, with opportunities afforded by economies of scale,


                                                                                            29
and the constraints of process imposed by construction industry. Comparisons between the
methodologies of these industries are discussed below.


Applications to building projects followed shortly. The Nationale-Nederland Building in
Prague and Team Disneyland Building drew on elements of the process proven on the
Barcelona Fish. The development of the firm’s process culminated with the opening of the
Guggenheim Bilbao museum in 1997. While refinements of the process continue, the
essential elements of the process and its applications were defined in the early successes of
these projects.


It would seem, from the success of these projects, that digital representation is poised to free
architecture from the constraints imposed by historically developed project description.
Complexity of geometric representation and methods of constructibility are apparent in the
design and construction of Gehry’s projects, but digital technology seems to have proven up
to the task of resolving this complexity. Digital modeling now allows free form, non-Euclidean
shapes to be represented with exacting tolerances. Digital CNC fabrication technologies,
developed to serve the automotive, aerospace, and Hollywood animation industries stand
ready for application to building, faithfully rendering building components to similar
exactness. The Boeing 777 project and other manufacturing processes have proven the
viability of a fully digital design development process. To the delight of some critics and the
dismay of others, digital technology seems poised to cast off the last relics of a historically
developed building context, translating the designer’s gesture effortlessly into final form
through Hollywood animation software coupled to robotic production devices. As post
modern historicism freed design from contextual constraints, digital representation seems
poised to remove the remaining constraints imposed by historically developed conventions of
building description and production.


It would be unfortunate to draw so simple a lesson from Gehry’s work. The firm’s ability to
successfully realize innovative forms springs partly from its ability to bring these projects
within the context of conventional construction documentation and building process. A view
of the development of Gehry’s body of work shows a formal language that originates in the
forms and materials of conventional construction, and an ongoing experimentation to press
these materials and methods to their limits. The succession of Gehry’s built projects shows a
gradual, continual coaxing of the conventions of fabrication and building, each work drawing

                                                                                             30
on the lessons learned from previous successes to push building method in new directions
and to further limits. The power of Gehry’s architecture springs partly from a struggle,
negotiation and ultimate reconciliation with existing context and conventions.


Part of the role of digital technology in the firm’s process has been to disclose simplicity
within the geometric complexity, and to bring the description of building elements and
processes within the conventional language of contemporary construction practice. This
discipline is key to the success the firm has enjoyed in successfully completing projects.
Perhaps surprisingly, much of the detailing of building components relies on extensions to
conventional processes of building, and seldom relies on aerospace or Hollywood methods
of object making. Rather, the firm strives to work with the existing processes of craftsmen
and fabricators, and attempts to produce detailing and documentation strategies that reflect a
deep understanding of the methods and constraints of existing fabrication processes. Two
dimensional documentation, flat patterns, Euclidean cut edges and profiles are the norm in
these fabrication methods. Digital technology is drawn on to render Gehry’s forms within
these conventions; is it not seen as an opportunity to discard the capabilities of traditional
craftsmanship. Part of the reason for this approach is of course necessity. Even where fully
digital fabrication technologies are available, the costs of these methods are frequently
prohibitive. But part of this methodology seems to be drawn from Gehry’s embracing of
material qualities and craftsmanship, and an aesthetic that pushes conventions to their limits,
rather than creating a design language from scratch.


Viewed from a geometric perspective, the methods drawn on in the digital description and
documentation of projects are enabled by capabilities for developing project descriptions in
full three dimensional, digital form, using non-Euclidean geometric constructs. However, the
reliance on non-Euclidean geometric constructs in no way means that these structures are
constraint free. Non-Euclidean, digital representations bring their own constraints and
artifacts to description processes, in the forms that can be represented, the geometric
operations that can be performed, and the fabrication processes that are enabled. This
structuring of non-Euclidean geometry on surface representation and associated
constructibility will be a central theme of this thesis. It will be shown that the non-Euclidean
representational constructs at the heart of the firm’s digital process can in fact be positioned
as extensions of Euclidean constructs into a more general framework, in which Euclidean
and a variety of non-Euclidean descriptive elements coexist on equal footing.

                                                                                             31

II. THE DEVELOPMENT OF GEHRY’S BUILDING PROCESS

In order to realize the innovations of Gehry’s forms on built projects, corresponding
innovations of design development and building process have been required. The firm’s
computational innovations have been developed parallel to, and as part of, these building
process innovations. To understand the context in which the firm’s digital process has
evolved, it is appropriate to review some of the guiding intentions of the firm’s building
delivery methodologies that these digital representations serve.



A.      PROJECT COST CONTROL
It may not be overstatement to say that project budget control – and the reconciliation of
design intent with project financial requirements – are the most important driving forces
behind the firm’s design development phase decisions. Certainly, project cost control has
been the most important factor in the development of the firm’s digital building delivery
process. This position may surprise readers. It is sometimes assumed that Gehry’s practice
engages predominately or exclusively in “budget less” projects, with clients for whom money
is no object. This is far from the truth. The firm has achieved its successful track record of
completed projects by providing buildings within clients’ budgets, and within the rough per
square foot costs of more conventional projects of similar building usage types.


Project costs can be broken down in a number of different ways. First, the distinction is often
made between the “soft costs” of a project, including the design services of architects and
engineers, versus the ‘hard” costs attributed to actual construction materials and labor.
Second, there is an important distinction to be made between costs identified prior to
commencement of construction, roughly up the GMP (Guaranteed Maximum Price) bid
phase, and cost overruns that can crop up during construction. Both of these distinctions are
subject to further inspection in light of the new forms and processes championed by Gehry’s
firm.


It is often assumed by owners that the hard costs of a building are a fixed factor in building
construction, while soft costs are an area for flexibility. This reasoning seems at a preliminary
glance to be valid. In theory, a 2x4 stud is a 2x4, a cubic foot of concrete is a known quantity.
The unit prices of these materials seem relatively fixed. Buildings of a certain size require
                                                                                              33
certain amounts of material. Metrics for these material quantities relative to square footages
of given construction types are available in the industry. Quantity estimating on conventional
construction is a fairly straight forward process. The estimator adds up linear wall lengths
from the 2D drawings, multiplies this length by the height of the walls to determine square
footages, throws in a percentage for material waste, and multiplies these quantities by
established local costs for the building materials and per quantity estimates of hours and
rates of construction labor, to arrive at a cost for the construction of a given building system.
If the client is interested in higher quality materials or construction, these decisions can
increase the cost of construction, but in theory the client “gets what he or she asks for” in
terms of a higher quality product. In turn, it is perceived that the soft costs of the architectural
and engineering services have some flexibility. If the architect spends less time in schematic
design, the number of billed hours can be reduced, beneficially impacting the bottom line of
the building construction budget. On many conventional building projects, the design
services are seen as an area to squeeze some cost reduction.


The above distinctions between soft and hard costs of construction may be valid for
conventional construction, where quantities and associated costs are relatively well
established. On unconventional construction, where established industry costs for the type of
construction are not available, the rules of the game are thrown wide open. Even the straight
forward activity of quantity estimating can be difficult to accurately perform if these quantities
can not be easily determined from conventional 2D documentation. Material waste factors
can be difficult to estimate, since atypically shaped building elements can be more difficult to
fit on industry standard sheets of material. The labor associated with unit quantities of
unconventional construction systems can be difficult to anticipate.


Even on conventional construction, construction budgeting is less of a science than it first
appears. For conventional construction, rough per unit cost rules of thumb are available in
the industry, and are known to architects and construction managers. These unit costs vary
widely from region to region, and are substantially impacted by short term localized economic
factors. Factors contributing to the cost of a given system include local availability of
materials and equipment, availability of skilled vs. unskilled labor and the influence of trade
unions, and competition among projects in a given locale for certain elements of
construction. A “hot” building market will drive up costs for most basic construction systems,
as demand for sub-contractors is driven up. The history of Gehry’s projects is rife with

                                                                                                 34
anecdotes of these local and temporary economic considerations. The economic feasibility of
titanium for the Guggenheim Bilbao project is traced to a temporary glut of available titanium
in the world market after the fall of the Soviet Union. The Big Dig project in Boston reduced
the available concrete contractors in the local market during the construction of the Stata
Center.   Low demand for skilled carpenters in the Czech Republic after the fall of
communism contributed to the development of a hybrid digital / manual fabrication process
for concrete panels of the Nationale – Nederland project.


The premium on direct hard costs associated with unconventional project geometry is an
important factor in preliminary project budgeting. This premium is acknowledged by clients as
a cost associated with the acquiring one of the firm’s designs. The rationale of cost
associated with receiving a superior product is applicable to Gehry’s buildings. Many
budgetary tradeoffs are made throughout schematic design phase decision making. For
example, Gehry’s design aesthetic suggests more economical, conventional materials used
in unconventional forms, in lieu of more expensive finishes applied to conventional geometry.
Mixing project geometry to include conventional construction and geometry along with more
highly shaped elements is an important element of the design process. These tradeoffs can
be managed in schematic design in order to meet client budget requirements.


A more problematic aspect of project budgeting can be identified, in terms of risk
management. In North America, construction sub contracts are typically awarded based on
guaranteed price bids. Typically, construction sub contracts are awarded through a
competitive bidding process, with the low bidder being awarded the contract. The recipient of
the contract is obligated to perform the agreed upon services – specified through project
documentation - for a contractually committed price. On conventional construction, sub
contract estimators have a good understanding of their internal unit price costs for
conducting work, and can make trade offs between competitive pricing and profit margin. On
unconventional construction, where prior experience and industry established price points do
not exist, cost estimation is difficult to conduct with any guarantee of successful completion
of the project. The level of risk associated with contracting to perform the work at any specific
price can be substantial. The result can be sub contractor bids containing large factors of
safety, which ultimately represent premiums on the price of construction. Many sub
contractors will simply elect not to consider taking on the work, reducing the competitive pool
of providers and resulting in higher cost bids being accepted. The premiums cannot be

                                                                                              35
construed to be costs associated with a superior product, but simply represent higher costs
for the same quality of construction. This price of risk can dwarf the premiums that can be
expected due purely to additional labor or materials.


While the pre-construction pricing exercises can jeopardize the commencement of a project,
lack of project and associated cost control during construction present even greater jeopardy
to the project and participating organizations. The major risks in terms of cost overruns
during construction can be traced to lack of dimensional coordination, and errors and
omissions in construction documentation or their interpretation. Errors in dimensional
coordination can result from mis-communication between trades, misunderstanding of
dimensions of components, and complexities of routing equipment through tight spaces,
such as duct runs of mechanical systems. Obvious errors of miscalculating dimensions on
traditional 2D documents or not updating dimensions on plans when updates and changes
are made occur all to frequently on conventionally documented construction drawings. When
such errors escape notice until they are discovered in the field, at best re-work is necessary.
More significantly, this rework can cause delays impacting many of the trades on the job. If
these delays are significant enough, they can cause a “ripple affect” where subsequent
trades are impacted. For example, the mis-sizing of a single primary steel beam, discovered
in the field can delay the placement of adjoining members while the erroneous member is
rebuilt and shipped. In turn, placement of any system to be attached to the primary steel
system may be held up. If delays are significant, they can put in jeopardy guaranteed
contracts with sub contractors, who may have other work scheduled in anticipation of
completing their portion of the job by a certain date. The costs of running a large construction
site per day can be substantial even without the subcontractor labor costs.


Improved project information provided by 3D CAD documentation has the potential to
address many of these issues, allowing control of, and dramatically reducing, the so called
“hard costs” of project construction. Much of the cost saving opportunities offered by
information technology can be traced to reduction of risk. By facilitating improved unit
quantity estimates early in schematic design, budget tradeoffs can be played out before
detailed design has begun. Improved dimensional coordination can be a direct outcome of
“virtually” constructing the building and its components to some level of detail prior to
generating contract documents. Tricky or idiosyncratic conditions for typical system details –
at corners or atypical interfaces with other systems – can be identified prior to committing

                                                                                             36
work contractually. Admittedly, this added information may give prospective bidders better
insight into the complexity of the project, resulting in higher initial bids. However, if this
complexity were to be discovered after the fact, disputes about the completeness of
construction documents would need to be resolved, likely resulting in remediation.


Part of the successful design development practices of Gehry’s firm results from the frequent
use of conventional system detailing, applied to unconventional geometry. The firm is
continually cognizant of the availability of locally available talented craftsmanship, and seeks
to take advantage of the materials and practices of their local construction practices. This is
part of the contextual aesthetic of Gehry’s designs, and an aspect of the respect of
craftsmanship for which the firm is known. One strategy for reducing project costs is to be
able to provide construction information in a format familiar to these local trades. The 3
dimensional project database allows information to be “sliced and diced” to extract
information supporting construction practices familiar to these local trades. If the description
of complex geometry can be provided in a format that supports practices familiar to these
trades, the risk factor can be reduced or eliminated. Complex geometry may still carry a
premium in labor and material, but these factors can be understood in terms of real impact
on the costs of construction, not buried in excessive cost contingencies to protect the
contractor from unknown risks.



B.     BUILDING TEAM ORGANIZATION AND INFORMATION FLOW
The conventions of contractual relationships among organizations participating in a
construction project vary widely in different parts of the world. In many ways, the North
American construction environment is among the most difficult for supporting unconventional
building practices. It is partly for this reason that many of the early successes of the firm’s
digital building delivery process were achieved on projects outside North America. Much of
the development of the divisions between design and construction teams can be traced to
the increase in construction litigation that has occurred in America since the 1950s. To
protect the various partners from litigation, strict boundaries have been defined for the scope
of responsibility each party takes on, and the flow of information between parties.

Figure II-1 diagrams the contractual relationship between organizations on a standard North
American design – bid - build project. The contractual relationships are organized as a tree.
The major contractual relationships are defined between the owner and architect, and owner
and contractor. The architect is “prime contractor” for the design team, which specifies the
scope of construction through construction drawings and specifications. The general
contractor is responsible for the construction of the project per the construction
documentation provided by the design team. All contractual relationships at the top of the
hierarchy are with the owner; no contractual relationship exists between the architect and
general contractor.


The architect sub-contracts for engineering services to structural, mechanical, acoustical,
lighting and other consulting engineers. Various specialist engineers may be enlisted to
perform peer review on the work of the engineering team. The design team completes the


                                                                                                                    38
specification of the project to demonstrate conformance with local building codes, and to
sufficient level of detail to guarantee in theory that the project can be built without errors or
conflicts between the activities of building trades.


The general contractor in turn apportions work, at their discretion, to internal resources or to
subcontractors. These contracts need only to guarantee that the specifications of the design
team are met; beyond these base line requirements the contractor is free to select any
contracting organizations that can reasonably be expected to perform the work. The
contractor will generally award sub contracts on the basis of lowest bid.


Sub contracting organizations “fill in the details” of the project specification through shop
drawings that describe building systems and components to a level of detail necessary for
actual construction. The sub contracting organizations have their own engineering teams that
conduct detailed engineering of system components to verify that proposed fabrication meets
the standards specified by the design team. Again in theory, the contract documents
provided by the design team have anticipated all the geometric and coordination conditions
that will occur as a consequence of the systems that have been selected for the project. In
practice, the level of detail performed by the design team to define the resolution of typical
conditions may not anticipate all the actual localized conditions generated by the specified
systems. The level of detail provided by the shop drawing detailing may be necessary to
disclose the full range of implications of a selected building system strategy. Any
discrepancies between general and actual localized conditions can be a source of dispute
between the design and construction teams. These shop drawings are submitted to the
design team for review, comment or exception. The design team is usually responsible for
guaranteeing that the details specified in the shop drawings can be dimensionally
coordinated between trades. Note that dimensional conflicts between the work of different
trades may not be apparent in any single trade’s shop drawing submissions. Coordination
through integrating information contained on numerous shop drawings may be required for
the design team’s review. Problems can be difficult to detect when this information is
contained on disparate two dimensional documents.


When a condition is detected by the sub contractor that is beyond the scope of the details
specified by the bid package, requests for information (RFIs) are generated by the sub
contractor and sent through the contractual hierarchy to the architect - as head of the design

team - for clarification of design intent. Depending on the severity of the condition, the design
team may issue a supplemental information document (SI), indicating that the design team
believes the condition is within the original intent of the contract documents. If the condition is
determined to be outside the scope of the details specified in the contract documents,
change orders may need to be generated. The generation of change orders indicate that
resolution of the condition is in fact beyond the scope of the original construction documents
and contract, and will frequently generate additional fees for the construction team. This
change of contractual scope will necessarily require the approval of the owner.


Information flow between organizations is strictly controlled along the paths of contractual
relationships (Figure II-2) . The parties higher up in the contractual tree are typically leery of
allowing their sub contractor organizations to communicate or make decisions directly with
other organizations, since they are ultimately responsible for the work of the subordinate
organizations. Worse, the fear is, subcontracting organizations may “leak” information about
internal decision making between contracting and sub contracting organizations to

                                                                                                               40
organizations “on the other side of the fence”, who may use this information to their
advantage if disputes arise.


When construction proceeds smoothly (which it seldom does, even on conventional
construction!) this strict control of information generation and dissemination protects all
parties from erroneous decision making that would jeopardize the intent of the project
specifications that form the basis of the contractual relationships. For conventional
construction, where the work of each party is fairly well defined by standard details and other
conventions of practice, the process of design and construction decision making can be
accommodated by this tightly contractually controlled process.


For innovative, complex or unconventional construction, the disaggregation of information
and limitations imposed on communications between decision makers can virtually
guarantee that problems will occur in project coordination. When they do occur during
construction, resolution of problems can be difficult. Problems which could be quickly fixed
on the spot - if the construction team had sufficient authority - require a chain of events and
decisions, above all a determination of the party responsible for the condition. While the
resolution of decisions are winding their way through the chain of command, construction
delays can ensue, further aggravating the impact the condition has on the project schedule
and cost. Communication technologies have been drawn on to assist in the speed of
resolution of on site conditions, including simple technologies (such as emailed digital
photos) and more elaborate technologies including information tracking Web sites.


More problematic for innovation of construction is that the true sources of fabrication
innovation – and the parties ultimately responsible for execution of this innovation – are the
fabricators themselves. These are the organizations that will ultimately be required to
develop innovations of process necessary to efficiently construct innovative project
geometries. This expertise is best included in the design process during design development
decision making, before the contract documents have been completed. In the contractual
scheme defined above, these entities are excluded from the decision making process.
Worse, sophisticated fabricators may be better informed of the actual effort and cost required
to perform sophisticated construction work. This knowledge may work to their detriment,
since the bids they submit may reflect the actual cost required to complete the project. Their
bids may be turned down by the general contractor in favor of less qualified fabricators, who

                                                                                            41
may turn out be unable to execute the work to which they have committed themselves. The
specification and bidding process also can fail to turn the award of contracts in favor of
fabricators who perform higher quality work.


Gehry’s design aesthetic has always tended to favored innovation of fabrication and craft
over that of engineering. These intentions would conspire to flip the standard contractual
process around. Theoretically, the fabricators would work directly with the architect and
engineers of the design team to provide the specification of the work to be performed.
Unfortunately, this tight relationship between design team and craftsmen violates many of the
contractual conventions of North American construction.


To address this issue, GP has occasionally – with the consent of owner and general
contractor - entered into unconventional contractual relations with fabricators in the design
development phase. These design assist contracts are forged between the architect and
skilled fabricators. The fabricator serves as a quasi consulting engineer for the specification
of a building system, and is compensated for this service. There is no commitment by the
general contractor to ultimately award the contract to the particular fabricator; it may be
awarded to the fabricator’s competition, if the fabricator’s bid is unreasonable. In practice,
this is however seldom the case.


A second issue of potential impact on contractual relations is the availability of computing
capabilities by the fabrication organizations. The accurate performance of shop drawing work
requires the fabricator to dig into the master model database. Until recently, the skills
necessary to operate CATIA, and familiarity with a 3D centric approach to detailing were
unavailable outside of Gehry Partners. While the ability to fabricate the components existed
in skilled fabrication shops, the necessary CAD expertise was not part of these organizations’
services. When CAD expertise existed, data would still need to be translated into formats
appropriate for the fabricator’s work. This lack of availability of computational expertise has
often required Gehry Partners to perform services as part of construction administration
phase activities, well beyond those conventionally within the architect’s scope. In order to
address the contractual ambiguity of these services, C-Cubed – Rick Smith’s CATIA
consulting organization – has often been recommended as a sub contractor to general
contractors and fabricators. C-Cubed provides both CATIA operator expertise, as well as
familiarity with the firm’s digital methodologies. C-Cubed has contracted directly to contractor

                                                                                             42
and sub contractor organizations to perform digital shop drawing services, removing Gehry
Partners from any direct work and contractual relationship with these organizations.


On recent projects, 3D CAD capabilities have become more prevalent in fabricating
organizations. Often these organizations have developed sophisticated digital methods of
their own, or have acquired 3rd party applications whose development targets the specific
activities of their trade. CAD activities to support these relationships have turned more
toward translation of data between the CATIA master model and these proprietary formats.
Often, Gehry Partners will engage in development of translation processes to serve particular
contracting organizations. These capabilities are officially provided “for reference only”; the
CATIA database remains the official format for 3D data on the firm’s projects. When
appropriate, GP has provided these translation technologies to the general contractor, who
becomes responsible for data coordination with their subcontractors.



C.     FABRICATION ECONOMIES
Building projects are predominately singular endeavors. Site conditions, local building
practices and codes, client specific requirements, and the need to work with locally based
construction firms and their heavy equipment, all are conditions that contribute to the
necessity for treating each project as a unique undertaking.


This characteristic is perhaps the single most important distinction between building
construction and product manufacturing industries. The products of manufacturing industries
vary widely in scale, complexity and cost. Airplanes are enormously complex design and
engineering endeavors, and carry very high unit costs. Only a few hundred or thousand units
may be produced over the lifetime of an aircraft product line. A toy is a relatively simple
object to engineer and produce. Hundreds of thousands or even millions of identical toys
may be produced in the lifetime of the product line.


Economies of scale unify the production these different manufactured products. There are
many implications of mass production on the economics and opportunities afforded by
product lines. With economies of scale, the up front cost of engineering and tooling design
required to develop the product line is distributed over the cost of each unit. Even if these
costs are high relative to the unit cost, substantial design and engineering activity can be

                                                                                            43
undertaken with limited impact on this unit cost. These implications impact the fabrication
methods available to mass production, and in turn have consequences on the shapes that be
manufactured. The tooling of dies for extrusion molding or stamping fabrication technologies
often represent a high fixed cost of product manufacturing. Metal stamping requires the
fabrication of a positive and negative dies. The manufacturing of these dies in manufacturing
is often a multi-step process. A wax positive form may be constructed, or highly finished CNC
routed positive is developed in foam. Then, a high strength negative form is cast from the
sculpted positive form. Depending on the stamping process, a second positive in high
strength material may be developed from the negative form, and a high strength steel die
formed from this element. This elaborate process can be easily justified for large scale runs
of identical parts. It is fairly obvious that application of such a process to one of a kind
component runs would be drastically expensive. Yet, for fully free form surface forms,
elements of a stamping or molding process are still required.


A more subtle implication of economies of scale – or lack thereof – is found in the cost of
information required to develop a given component.          This cost of information can be
identified in the design, engineering, and modeling or drafting associated with the
development of the component. With large product runs, the cost of engineering and
modeling a component is again a small component of the cost of fabricating the individual
unit. In the development of singular products and components, the relative cost of
engineering to that of materials or fabrication labor can be high. It may be more economical
to over design the specification for all units, adding more material and hence strength into the
objects’ designs, than to engineer each unit to a more optimal configuration. Similarly, it may
be more cost effective to use additional fabrication effort - allowing the craftsman working on
the component to figure out aspects of the component’s configuration – than it would be to
fully detail an individual component through computer based or traditional drafting.


Issues of mass production have been a topic for architecture since the industrial revolution44.
While a full treatment of this topic is well beyond the scope of this thesis, some observations
may be made on the geometric organization of building projects and its affordance of mass
production. The regularized, Euclidean organizations of building layout strategies have
historically provided the basis for incorporating mass produced elements. Modular systems
based on grid layouts - repetition of rectangular dimensions in the organization of building
designs – allow components of identical proportions to be mass produced and deployed

                                                                                             44
across the project. Countless examples of such designs exist, we note in passing much of
the work of Mies van der Rohe and fellow high modernists. These strategies rely on
dimensional repetition as a means for achieving geometric symmetries supporting the
incorporation of identical elements. Rotatational symmetries afford similar dimensional
repetition. Variations in localized performance requirements may exist across elements of
identical dimensions. The wind forces on the glazing modules of high rise buildings are
greater at the top than at the bottom. This localized performance variation may be trivially
satisfied by over designing the unit to satisfy the worst case design conditions; the
inefficiency of deploying materials in a less than optimal fashion may be vastly outweighed
by the informational economy of engineering the unit a single time.


There is perhaps an even greater body of built work drawing on regularities of Euclidean
geometry to support systems founded on mass produced raw materials. The conventional
American 2x4 system is a key such example. This system does not require modular
dimensions, but rather relies on easily formed raw materials with certain assumed constraints
on the building geometry to which they will be applied. The obvious constraints of the 2x4
system are planar wall, floor and roof geometries. Straight, rectangular edges and
perpendicular wall organizations are suggested by this system; however, the system can
accommodate angles between planar elements and non-perpendicular edges with minor
customization. Gehry’s early work (Section IV.A) explored the limits of these building
systems and materials.


The non-repetitive geometries that characterize Gehry’s recent work afford neither modular
dimensional regularities nor other regularities afforded by Euclidean systems. However, in
order to satisfy budgetary and schedule requirements on the firm’s projects, systematic
building strategies are still required. This imperative has caused design development
strategies and geometric modeling efforts to pursue the identification of geometric
regularities that do exist in the design geometry, or can be imposed on the geometry with
minimal impact on the design intent. The term rationalization (Section III.F, below) is used
within the firm to describe this process of pursuing and incorporating geometric regularities in
the building form. The disclosure and constructibility implications of geometric regularities in
non-Euclidean geometry are a central topic of this thesis. Considerable discussion of
different geometric forms present in Gehry’s designs, the regularities inherent to these


                                                                                             45
geometries, and constructibility strategies that take advantage of these regularities will be
provided in Parts 2 and 3 of this thesis.



D.     MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGIES AND METHODS
CNC (Computer Numerically Controlled) production methods hold promise to alleviate some
of the geometric constraints on mass production strategies. CNC fabrication equipment can
dramatically reduce the labor associated with controlled fabrication of custom components.
CNC technologies include a variety of different technologies, including laser or plasma
cutting of flat sheet materials, automated hole punching used in structural steel fabrication, 3
and 5 axis routing, automatic lathing, and full fledged robotic manufacturing. However, there
are economic and formal considerations in applying these technologies. The cost of this
equipment is substantial relative to more conventional fabrication equipment. This up front
cost must be amortized over the life of the machine, which can in it self result in significant
costs per cutting operation. Certain combinations of materials, sizes of elements and shapes
have no current CNC solutions. For example, re-configurable mold technologies are currently
being researched, but to date these technologies are unavailable in commercial applications
for high quality fabrication of steel plate or other high strength materials. The cost of
generating and processing the information necessary to drive the equipment must be
considered as well. Long machine run times on expensive equipment (such as 5 axis milling)
can make applications of these technologies prohibitively expensive. Computer based
modeling requires highly skilled operators, frequently working on high priced workstations
and software. The amount of information necessary to generate shop drawing information for
CNC fabrication may be more than that necessary to generate equivalent shop drawings for
manual fabrication. To date, few building fabrication shops have invested in these
technologies. The limited competition among firms for this type of work has to date resulted
in premiums for full CNC enabled approaches to building component generation. Certainly,
we can expect to see continual reductions in the cost of these technologies over time. The
automation of shop drawing production combined with the ongoing reduction in cost of
computer hardware promises to beneficially impact the cost of generating building
components with unique configurations.


Gehry’s firm has promoted the use of CNC manufacturing technologies in these production
processes. CNC technologies are utilized in the manufacturing process to produce the

                                                                                             46
custom geometry of individual components at exact tolerances. Manufacturing tool paths
may be exported directly from the CATIA master model to the CNC production equipment,
resulting in building components that conform to the local geometric requirements of the
project. The building systems that result from this method offer tremendous flexibility in
addressing programmatic or aesthetic considerations. Using CNC production methods tied
directly to the definitive 3D project information additionally results in improved coordination of
connection geometries throughout the project, fewer dimensional conflicts between building
system components, and fewer costly modifications of components at the construction site.


In other situations, the more traditional methods associated with manual construction
techniques have proven to be more cost effective.       When traditional construction methods
are adopted, the resulting systems are subjected to similar requirements of dimensional
coordination with the three dimensional computer master model. To fulfill this requirement,
manual fabrication is directed through the use of loft drawings - full scale construction
templates. With the full three dimensional model in place, information may be extracted in
forms appropriate for the support of traditional trade practices.


The processes that have been developed by the firm provide interfaces to both traditional
manual construction practices, and to technical innovations associated with CNC
manufacturing. For each building system, a manufacturing process is developed through
close collaboration between Gehry’s firm and partnering fabricators. The resulting process is
rigorously substantiated through full scale mockups in conjunction with computer modeling
and analysis, and subjected to value engineering assessment. The approach which is
ultimately pursued can combine traditional, manual construction techniques with advanced
computer based manufacturing methods, to arrive at an optimal solution both from the
perspective of cost as well as the quality of the resulting system.



E.     DIMENSIONAL TOLERANCES
Building construction neither provides nor requires the tight fabrication tolerances of aircraft
and automotive manufacturing. The tightest tolerances that can be achieved through typical
fabrication and construction techniques are on the order of 1/8” to 1/16”. In practice many
building fabrication systems have far lower tolerances. Primary structural steel fabrication in
North America can be expected to have tolerances of no better than 1 inch. These tolerances

                                                                                               47
differ greatly from those expected in manufacturing industries, where tolerances tighter than
1 mil may be expected. CNC fabrication methods can offer higher tolerances of components
to their corresponding digital description. However, CNC developed components often still
require assembly through traditional manual methods, and the typical construction tolerances
are often re-introduced into these systems during manual assembly. As a general rule, one
can anticipate a premium for fabrication with tighter construction tolerances, and lower
tolerances for one of a kind objects relative to those produced through machine automated
mass production methods.


Construction tolerances are closely related to the issue of dimensional control of the project.
The exacting numerical specificity of contemporary CAD modeling applications are of little
utility if building components can not reasonably be expected to be accurately positioned in
space in conformance with the digital model. On site digital surveying capabilities allow
components to be positioned in space in tight conformance with the digital model. However,
the labor involved with positioning building components through digital surveying is
significant. Building system strategies that rely on sampling vast quantities of surveyed points
can be expected to have associated project cost and schedule implications. Even if such
exacting positioning of certain building system elements is presumed, the relative fabrication
tolerances of adjoining building components can require adjustable connection strategies for
resolving dimensional discrepancies.


An alternative strategy for positioning building components is to rely on one building system
to serve as the positioning device or dimensional control mechanism for adjoining elements.
The benefits of such a strategy are readily apparent. The dimensional control element serves
simultaneously as building component, jig for the positioning of other elements, and
structural support for the elements that join it. This requires, however, that the dimensional
control element be fabricated to the construction tolerances required of the adjoining
elements, with associated costs of a potentially high tolerance fabrication. Typically, the
dimensional control component will be a more primary element than the elements that frame
in. The costs for fabricating primary structural elements to tight tolerance may be far greater
than that of fabricating secondary systems to similar tolerances. For example, primary steel
can be used as the dimensional control for a stud framed wall system that it supports. The
construction tolerances of the stud wall system are dictated by the requirements of the
cladding system, while primary steel would normally be subject to more generous tolerances

                                                                                             48
than that required for the wall system. This generates a higher unit cost for the primary steel.
On the other hand, only relative system conformance to the dimensions specified in the CAD
model may be required. The positioning of framing members in the above example may need
to tightly correspond to the edge geometry of the primary steel and to one another, but where
this assemblage winds up relative to other elements of the project may be of little
consequence. If so, then the tolerance requirements of the dimensional control system can
be relaxed.


CNC fabrication technologies can often support the development of registration information
as part of the fabrication process. Laser or plasma cutting tools, operated at lower power
levels than required to burn through material, can allow dimensionally accurate registration
marks and even textual annotation as part of the cutting process66.


Issues of tolerance and dimensional control have profound implications for project cost and
quality. Tolerance decisions can not be isolated from the system design and modeling
strategies. These decisions will have implications for manufacturability, erection and project
cost which can impact the design, coordination and site logistics with implications beyond the
actual system on which these decisions are made. A judicious use of tolerance and flexibility
in the dimensional control of project geometries has been an important part of the firm’s
success in realizing projects within reasonable construction budgets.

III. THE MASTER MODEL METHODOLOGY


A.       INTRODUCTION
The master model methodology represents the technological core of Gehry Partner’s digitally
assisted building delivery process. Broadly stated, the project master model is an integrated
repository for three dimensional CAD based descriptions of all aspects of project
construction. The geometric nature of these descriptions, and the utilities it serves in guiding
the development of the built project and the coordination of building processes will be
considered in some detail.


The master model methodology grew out of early experiments in paperless shop drawing
development discussed in the introduction provided in Chapter I. However, substantial
development of both digital technologies and the building development methodologies that
these technologies support has taken place, from the early, relatively simple applications on
Gehry’s sculptural projects to current iterations serving full design, engineering and
construction activities on the firm’s current major projects.


Although the master model approach has been developed on a specific technology platform
– Dassault Systèmes CATIA software product line – and is informed by technologically
driven methodologies developed by Dassault to serve large scale complex manufacturing
projects, the firm’s technological methodology is wider in reach than reliance on any specific
software product would allow. Nor is the methodology exclusively 3D centric, since support of
conventional two dimensional documentation remains a requirement for successful operation
in current construction practice. Ultimately, the master model methodology is exactly that, a
methodology and an associated set of practices oriented toward the integration of project
data through digital representation. Some of the goals of this methodology are to:
     Provide an common, integrating framework for all geometric project data, regardless of
     source;
     Support the extraction of geometry necessary for completion of all engineering and
     construction activities, in geometric forms and data formats appropriate to these
     activities;
     Allow the extraction and re-integration of “traditional” two dimensional project
     documentation;
                                                                                             51
   Support high resolution description of continuously curved surface and curve
   representations, and operations on these geometries;
   Support a design methodology centered around the creation of physically based design
   artifacts;
   Support a design development process requiring the incremental geometric development
   of building systems descriptions and intentions, corresponding to the incremental
   development of project information associated with project phasing;
   Support information control mechanisms appropriate for the development of building
   projects in light of industry standard project control and contractual practices.


It is important to recognize that the innovative use of three dimensional digital models
represents only one component of the firm’s process. The firm’s success in realizing its
projects is due in no small part to the development of methodologies that integrate three
dimensional digital models with two dimensional drawings and other conventional project
information. The master model technologies represent an extension – not abandonment - of
conventional project descriptions and processes. The rationale behind the development of
this hybrid process are partly related to cost control. In the current construction environment,
fully digitally capable construction and fabrication partners do not always exist. Where they
do, the costs of advanced CNC fabricated components may be much higher than that of
traditional processes. The hybrid process allows these economic and quality tradeoffs to be
made on a case by case basis, even within the scope of a single project. More importantly,
Gehry’s building occurs within the context of traditionally based construction environment.
Substantial existing conventions of practice have been developed around two dimensional
construction documentation. On large scale projects, disregarding these conventions in favor
of a wholly unprecedented approach would be both impractical and dangerous.




                                                                                             52
                        Figure III-1: Elements of 3D master model (DCH)


The ambitious agenda for digital project data raises questions of appropriate geometric
representational formats, and the level of data development appropriate for each party’s
function in the building process. The full rendition of building components in 3-dimensional
solid form would represent a level of effort well beyond that supportable even with generous

                                                                                         53
architectural fees. This is not simply a question of the firm’s economics, but also a question
of the level of project development and associated project responsibility allocated to the
design team. As with conventional documentation, the architect developed project geometry
to a certain level of detail, sufficient for other parties to build on and refine. The result is that
project geometry provided as part of the architectural contract documents is surprisingly
reduced and representational in terms of its level of geometric detail. However, the geometry
that is shown provides the correct nominal dimensional control geometry for the indicated
components.


An illustrative example is shown in Figure III-2.
This model shows the 3D CAD component of
the contract documents for the Experience
Music Project’s structural rib system. The
model shows the location and positioning of
the structural ribs and cross bracing, and the
supporting concrete foundation. Each system
is represented with a different geometric
abstraction, reflecting the scope of detail
provided   as   part   of the    design    team’s
package. These abstractions provide the
geometric information necessary to position
the element in space and for the steel
contractor to further develop the structural
detailing. The structural concrete foundation is
provided in full solid form, and correctly
reflects the nominal surface of construction
necessary for the development of concrete
formwork. However, the structural ribs are for       Figure III-2: Structural wireframe contract model

between top and bottom curves. This representation provides only the dimensional
information necessary for the structural fabricator to understand material quantities involved,
and to geometrically guide the further development of the full rib geometry. The rest of the
information necessary to satisfy the performance criteria of the ribs are found in conventional
two-dimensional detail drawings and text based specifications. Text based rib numbering is

                                                                                                   54
provided in the model to allow cross referencing with schedules and other information in the
conventional documentation. The cross bracing between ribs is provided in even simpler
form, as single line elements cast between the top and bottom chords of the ribs.


Each of these geometric descriptions represent substantially impoverished abstractions
relative to what one might imagine as a full geometric description of the structural elements.
Much more information is needed to fully develop these systems in shop drawings: bolt
holes, splices, weld specifications, etc. But this information is not typically considered to be
part of either the architect or structural engineer’s scope of work. The design team would not
receive compensation for the effort or responsibility associated with providing this detailed
information in the contract model. The level of geometric detail also reflects project phasing
considerations, and the level project geometry known at the point in time of construction
documentation. Providing additional geometry would likely be extraneous, since the
structural detailer would likely request modifications of the geometry based on their more
extensive knowledge of their fabrication process. These changes would then need to be
carried forward by updating the master model geometry.         More importantly, provision of
excessive information by the design team would blur the boundaries of scope between the
design and construction teams. If substantially detailed geometry were provided in contract
documents, and then modifications of this geometry were required during shop drawing
phase, these modifications would reflect changes relative to the construction documentation
and hence to the contract itself. These changes could result in change orders or possibly
invalidation of the contract. This re-opening of contractual agreements could ultimately result
in additional fees to the construction team, even if the geometry and fabrication were simpler
than that specified in the model.


This example serves to illustrate a critical point in the development of the master model
methodology: the selections of geometric representation in the digital documents reflect the
nature of the processes and relationships between parties of the project. These decisions are
of enormous significance to the control of the construction process. Such implications are not
new to a digital centric process; conventions in divisions of labor and associated project
description exist in paper driven construction projects with conventional geometries and
fabrication systems. However, in more traditional projects these conventions are well defined
in the nature of existing practice. The scope of project development associated with each
participating organization, and the descriptive conventions associated with performing this

                                                                                             55
work, are largely pre-determined. Legally binding standards for level of professional practice
are defined relative to the information contained in conventional documentation.


The re-development of these practices in light of digital technology requires all of the
conventions embedded in traditional documentation to be reviewed. The nature of each
participant’s scope of work in developing project definition is subject to reconsideration.
Agreements between the parties regarding the type of information needed to perform
allocated work, and the scope of responsibility assumed by parties in providing this
information, need to be defined. Specifications need to be created to establish what these
geometric abstractions represent, and the ways in which this information is to be used or not
used. These decisions and agreements need to be revisited each time a new partnering
organization is brought into the process, and each time a new building system is designed.


As a general rule in the firm’s process, three dimensional models are provided as part of the
legally binding project construction documentation. The 3D models specify the minimal
dimensional information needed to develop spatially coordinated system components.
Information necessary for quantity takeoffs is provided in these models, to some level of
detail and abstraction. The specifications of component performance and connection
detailing   are   provided   through   conventional   two-dimensional    documentation.    The
conventions established for these project descriptions are expressed in the (textually based)
project specifications, including what each form of documentation provides, how the
information is to be used, and which documentation governs in case of conflicts.


As the firm’s digital process has matured, the level of detail represented in the jointly
developed project database has dramatically expanded, and the amount of information
provided solely in two dimensional form has diminished. Geometric abstractions have
become less abstract; more geometric detail is provided as part of the design documentation.
This expansion of geometric detail parallels an expansion of the firm’s services from that of a
design architect to full architectural services on many projects. Substantial experience with
certain types of building systems often used on its projects has led the firm to provide
increasingly detailed geometric specifications of these systems. Nonetheless, the mantra
developed early in the firm’s process development still applies as a guiding principal:


“Draw all - and only - the information necessary.”

                                                                                             56
B.     PROJECT CONTROL
Beginning in design development phase,
responsibility for development of portions of
the project description begins to be turned
over to partnering organizations – engineers,
construction   managers      and    fabricators.
Elements of the 3D models are turned over to
these partnering entities, who begin to develop
the project information required for their roles
in the process. The information developed by
these organizations needs to be coordinated.       Figure III-3: Coordination model of ceiling space
                                                                         (DCH)
Project coordination is within the traditional
scope of the architect’s role on a building project. Conventionally, this role is conducted by
reviewing 2D drawing documentation provided by each partnering organization in format
founded on conventions of their discipline. Coordination of the assembled body of
documentation from these numerous partners in their native physical drawing formats is an
extraordinarily difficult undertaking, and a major source of errors and omissions on
construction projects.


The comprehensive 3D model that resides at the center of the firm’s process provides an
enormous aid for coordination. Even when two dimensional documentation is employed by a
partner, this 2D documentation can be translated back into three dimensions, and oriented
appropriately in 3D space relative to the other information on the project. When partners
employ 3D documentation – as is increasingly becoming the case – this information may be
directly imported and overlaid on the architectural models. The result is a comprehensive
repository for all geometric data generated by the partners in the design process. By
assembling and filtering this information, the process of system coordination is radically
improved. System interferences may be detected, either via visual inspection or through tools
that automate checking for spatial clashes or violations of system envelopes by other
systems.




                                                                                                 57
Time    based    visualization   of   construction
sequencing has become a useful coordination
tool on the firm’s larger projects, including the
Experience Music Project, the Disney Concert
Hall, and the Stata Center at MIT.             This
detailed coordination of on site activities is part
of the general contractor’s responsibility. The
enabling technology – developed by Disney
Imagineering in collaboration with Stanford
                                                      Figure III-4: CIFE’s 4D modeling tool (DCH)
University’s Center for Integrated Facilities
Management (CIFE)40 allows 3D project geometry to be associated with information from
project scheduling software such as Primavera.              Project managers and personnel
responsible for on-site coordination can simulate the progression of activities on the
construction site.



C.      PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
The ease by which specific engineering and other analytical models may be supported is a
core benefit of the 3D project master model. The transfer of project information to and from
formats satisfying the requirements of engineering and fabrication partners is a critical
component of design development activities.


Numerous computational engineering analysis techniques have become available over the
past two decades. Examples of such techniques include structural analysis, energy
simulation and computation fluid dynamics based air flow studies, equipment performance
simulation, as well as lighting and acoustic simulation. Much of this development has been
through the use of finite element and finite difference techniques. These techniques
approximate complicated geometric forms into assemblies of simplified elements. The global
solution for the form is achieved by simultaneous solution of the individual elements’
performances. These techniques are well suited to the analysis of the geometry on Gehry’s
projects. The feasibility of Gehry’s recent projects is due in no small measure to the
availability of these analytical approaches.




                                                                                                58
In conventional architectural processes, if such simulations are required, a special 3D model
must be constructed, on the basis of 2D plans or other conventional documentation, and for
the sole purpose of the particular analysis. Re-use of these models for other purposes in
conventional architectural processes is generally not practical.


With the availability of a comprehensive, three dimensional project description, the level of
effort required to provide specific analytical models becomes greatly reduced. In the firm’s
process, some representation of the system under inquiry is often available in the master
model by the time that the analysis is required. Many of these techniques are undertaken
relative to 3D geometric models in proprietary formats. However, software packages are
continuing to improve their ability to import elements of these proprietary descriptions from
neutral geometry formats.


Finite element structural analyses (FEA) have
been conducted on virtually all recent Gehry
projects, and are a critical part of project structural
engineering activities. Often, the finite element
models can be developed directly from the
structural system wire frame from the master
model. Typically, the project wireframe provides
only the geometric definition of the positioning of
elements.     Additional     information     including
materials, sectional properties and nodal degrees
                                                          Figure III-5: Finite element analysis of frame
of freedom must be added to the engineering                                    (Riscal)
model.    Currently,    finite   element    structural
software typically can not accept curved elements, a direct consequence of the geometries of
finite elements that serve as the basis for these solution techniques. The project geometry
must be rationalized (Section III.F) into segmented linear members and triangulated plate
sections prior to import into the FEA solver.


FEA structural analysis results in additional information pertinent to subsequent phases of
structural system development, including the specification of member sections and load
information at the connections. The firm’s pursuit of comprehensive digitally based processes
suggests that this information be translated directly back into the master model and on to

                                                                                                     59
steel detailing and fabrication applications. To date, the full re-integration of FEA model
information has been only partly successful. This is partly due to the “degradation” of project
geometry that occurs in approximating curved project geometry into linearized elements,
described above. The geometric approximations required for fabrication can involve different
geometric abstractions than those required for FEA analysis. Translating critical, non
geometric performance information between applications and across the division between
the design and construction teams has to date been deemed to involve too great a risk to
undertake without human oversight. Finally, the project geometry is typically not refined to
the level required for structural detailing at the point in time of structural analysis. Structural
analysis requires only fairly loose geometric tolerance relative to that required for fabrication.
Dimensional approximations of frame elements of several inches have negligible effects on
project loads, member sizing and modal analysis. This level of construction tolerance would
obviously be unacceptable for final detailing. Nonetheless, many of these limitations are
procedural more than any technical limitation of digital translation. Currently, geometry and
sectional information are translated directly from the master model to both FEA and detailing
applications. It can be anticipated that this digital
integration     of      analytical      and     fabrication
processes will continue to be expanded.


Computational           Fluid        Dynamics       (CFD)
techniques are becoming widely used in building
energy and life safety applications. CFD can be
used to model air, energy and particulate flows
through spaces with complex shapes. In energy
studies, these techniques are often combined
with radiant analysis of solar gains to assess
building      heating     and        cooling    strategies.
Advanced building energy strategies such as
displacement ventilation or natural heating and
cooling can require this detailed analysis of air
and energy flows in their design.


CFD is also used to simulate smoke and heat                   Figure III-6: CFD fire safety analysis
                                                                          (Weatherhead)
migration through atria and other interior spaces.

                                                                                                       60
These applications are critical to the feasibility of Gehry’s projects, since existing life safety
codes are difficult to interpret in the context of Gehry projects. Codes typically allow
variances in conditions where minimum safety conditions can be proven. Typically, the
driving condition for fire safety is the time between the beginning of a fire event and the
incursion of a specified density of smoke into occupied regions of the building. CFD
applications allow specific fire events to be simulated. The dispersion of smoke through atria
can be simulated, along with the behavior of fire doors, smoke dispersion fans and other fire
safety equipment.


These simulation techniques require the generation of a negative space model delineating
the boundaries of spaces enclosed by the building surfaces, which are readily extracted from
the building geometry model (Figure III-6). Typically, adjoining walls, roof and floor surfaces
must be extracted from the master model, then trimmed to each other to form a closed solid.
The negative space model must then be tessellated into triangular facets to conform to the
geometric requirements of the simulation technique.


Historically, the computational requirements of such techniques, and the necessity for trained
engineering operators to run and interpret results, has relegated advanced performance
simulation techniques to confirmation or final engineering assessment, conducted late in
design development. The increasing speed of personal computing and availability of
performance simulation software for personal computers has raised the possibility of drawing
engineering simulation techniques into the set of tools available for schematic design
iterations. The possibility of using performance analysis iteratively as part of the design
process has been explored in many areas. Often, the level of accuracy required during early
design development is at a much more qualitative level than would be required for the final,
detailed engineering. These limitations on the required level of analytical detail can translate
into corresponding reductions of computing complexity, fostering more interactive
applications of these analytical techniques.


A variety of applications of such schematic performance simulations have found use on
Gehry’s projects. The use of CFD as an iterative tool to assess wind flow and associated
pedestrian comfort was applied to massing studies on the MIT Stata Center Project20 (Figure
III-7). Visualization software is frequently used for shadow studies to assess natural lighting
and energy performance (Figure III-8).

                                                                                               61

The use of materials simulation techniques, described in Chapter VII, is a further example of
the interactive performance applications that become available through tradeoffs between
simulation accuracy and speed. This migration of performance analysis techniques from
engineering to design applications is an important opportunity for the development of project
design activities, and is again enabled through the existence of the building master model.

D.      3D – 2D INTEGRATION
The need to of carry both three dimensional and two dimensional descriptions of the project
through the many design iterations and document submissions over the lifetime of a
construction project has been one of the most difficult aspects of the firm’s digital process.
There are many reasons why two dimensional representations remain a necessary
component of project descriptions for the foreseeable future:


     Interaction needs to occur with many organizations using traditional processes.
     Increasingly, technologically sophisticated partners are available who can provide
     favorable   prices   for   services   through   efficiencies   generated   by   technological
     advancement. However partners may, for regional cultural or economic reasons, provide
     the best price for services through traditional methods, or there may simply be no
     technologically enabled alternatives.


     It is largely the building agencies that remain most firmly entrenched in conventional
     documentation processes. These are the local governmental authorities that approve
     building permits, and review code compliance. These agencies need approval processes
     that serve the “lowest common denominator” for building projects within their jurisdiction.
     They also have neither direct financial incentives nor economic resources to justify
     technological advancements of process. Most building agencies will not accept even two
     dimensional CAD documentation.


     Building information is often symbolic in nature at points in the design process. Elements
     such as door swings, tile patterns and bathroom fixtures either do not merit full 3D
     geometric description, or the full geometric nature may not be known at a given point in
     time. The building description is facilitated by treating these elements as symbols on
     plans, rather than developing such abstract or trivial information into detailed three
     dimensional representations. As technology continues to be adopted industry wide, and

                                                                                               63
   efficient standards for including and reviewing this information become available, this
   symbolic information may eventually be migrated to a three dimensional form.


   Many building components have important two dimensional qualities. Many of the
   efficiencies in building systems used on Gehry projects are derived from building
   components that are essentially two dimensional. CNC cut plate elements, flattenable
   surface elements, floor finishes, all have geometric natures efficiently expressed through
   appropriately oriented two dimensional views.


For these reasons, two dimensional project descriptions are likely to be an important element
of design and construction processes for some time to come. The technical and procedural
integration of 3D and 2D information is a substantial focus of technological development by
the firm. At times, the process has had the flavor of maintaining a dual database: one
database of three dimensional data, and the other embodied in two dimensional drawings.
The process of integrating between these two representations, distanced by technological
and representational conventions, is not yet ideal.


A number of technological approaches support this integration between 2D and 3D project
representations. However, not all are applicable to complex non-Euclidean geometry. Until
recently, brute force geometric operations were required to extract drawings from 3D models.
Section cuts could be easily generated by intersecting the model geometry with a plane at
the location of the cut. Utilities also existed for performing isometric or perspective
projections. However, hidden line removal utilities did function correctly for all geometric
objects. Laborious geometric operations were needed to remove hidden geometry such as
pattern curves on surfaces. Creation of section / projection views required manually splitting
the master model at the cut plane, and erasing geometry prior to drawing extraction! This two
dimensional geometry was then exported to AutoCAD and cleaned up. Finally, annotation,
text, and hatching, line weight correction and other two dimensional “dress up” were
manually applied in 2D.


Even minor changes to the project geometry required redoing the entire process. Existing
two dimensional annotations could be manually repositioned, rather than re-drawing. Any
drawings unaffected by changes in geometry would of course not be re-processed. The
whole process took enormous amounts of time for each revision. In times of project

                                                                                           64
deadlines, shorts would be taken. The 2D drawings might be manually changed, rather than
modifying the 3D geometry and repeating the process. The result has been difficulty in
maintaining the integrity of the dual database. This difficulty was exacerbated as the detail in
project models has grown.


This dual 2D / 3D nature of project geometry, and the necessity for its integration has been
known to software developers for some time. Various approaches to the 2D / 3D integration,
and the integration of symbolic expressions of project information with geometric
representations, have been proposed by researchers and vendors. The support of automatic
3D to 2D geometric extractions has improved. Other approaches involving the “intelligent” re-
writing of the building objects in various contexts have been proposed as well. For example,
AutoDesk’s Architectural Desktop software allows walls, and other project objects to be
drawn in 2D, while retaining knowledge of their behavior and representation in 3D. This
approach works satisfactorily for conventional, Euclidean project geometry, but is ill suited to
Gehry’s geometry, where the 3D behavior of building geometry can not easily be predicted
from simple two dimensional views. The firm’s strategy has been to find ways to easily
embed necessary project information in 3D representations, then draw on more powerful
geometric and symbolic extraction mechanisms to produce 2D representations.


Recent enhancements in the CATIA modeling platform promise to streamline this process.
The software allows parametric definitions of geometric drawing extractions to be defined in
a persistent manner. Section cuts can be defined in the 3D model space. When project
geometry is modified, drawing extraction is achieved through a simple (though slow in terms
of computer time) update request. These improvements have allowed an approximately 90%
increase   in   operator   efficiency   for   generating   backgrounds   for   two   dimensional
documentation from the 3D model. Opportunities for automated extraction to 2D of
annotation from non geometric attributes defined on 3D objects are also being pursued.
Figure III-9 provides views of this drawing extraction process. These developments promise
an eventual integration of two- and three- dimensional information into a single,
comprehensive project database.




                                                                                             65
Figure III-9: Drawing extraction from the CATIA master model (MOT)




                                                                     66
               Figure III-10: Re-integration of two dimensional information in 3D (MIT)

Once these two dimensional extractions and annotations have been developed, it is of great
benefit to be able to integrate this data back into the master project geometry, to allow review
and coordination. This is easily achieved by importing the 2D CAD documents into the 3D
environment, then moving and rotating the geometry back into alignment with the plane of
the original cut. CATIA now allows AutoCAD files – exported through IGES format – to be
permanently fixed to a location and orientation in space. Changes in the 2D drawing are thus
automatically updated in the master model. Figure III-10 shows this overlaid 2D geometry –
including projections of the geometry below – oriented with the project master model, which
in turn has been cut at the level of the 2D drawing.


Many other applications of two dimensional extractions need to be supported in addition to
the comprehensive documentation required for architectural documentation. The generation
of shop drawings for certain systems can require numerous two dimensional extractions. For

                                                                                             67
example, concrete detailing requires many simple plan and section cuts of small areas of the
project for detailed layout of re-bar. The utility of simple sketch drawings is preferable to the
detailed generation of 3 dimensional layouts in this case. These simple cuts are easily
achieved by planar intersections with the project geometry. Usually, these operations are
performed either by the fabricator or by the general contractor as a service to the fabricator.



E.     THE PHYSICAL / DIGITAL INTERFACE
The role of physical objects in Gehry’s design process has had a profound role in the
development of the firm’s digital process. In any architectural or product design process, this
relationship exists, since the products of the process are ultimately physical objects. Other
firms do on occasion generate presentation models using CAD / CAM prototyping. The
unique aspects of the physical / digital interaction in Gehry’s process stem from the authority
bestowed on physical objects and processes of making. Physical models are the primary
elements of the process where the project design is developed. These physical objects
define and embody the formal design intent as it is developed over the course of the project.
Digital representations serve to capture this intent and allow for its processing and
communication.


On more conventional project geometry, this division between physical and digital
representation might not be so problematic. There are perfectly adequate ways of digitally
and physically modeling orthogonally configured planar objects, and great geometric affinity
between these digital and physical forms. Digitizing such conventional geometries is straight
forward. A few dimensions can be measured, and then orthogonal planes can be positioned
in digital space and intersected to form boundaries of surfaces. It is even arguable that the
digital representation of such assemblies is a “better” representation of the design intent.
Physical modeling necessarily introduces fabrication errors relative to pure Euclidean
geometry. Materials warp, elements are cut too short or too long, edges are not perfectly
straight, corners are not completely tight. While these imperfections might be imperceptible
on well constructed scale models, when fully scaled these imperfections would likely be
outside of construction tolerances. A gap at a corner of 1/32” on an 1/8” scale model represents
a 3” hole at the corner of the construction! CAD modeling allows these imperfections to be
cleaned up to within machine tolerances, well below the tolerances of construction. It is thus
arguable that, if the design intent of a project is concerned with Euclidean geometry, digital

                                                                                              68
modeling can provide a more exact representation for the description of this intent than any
scale physical representation. 3D CAD can even be a more efficient interface for generating
this geometry, as the digital tools for performing cutting, positioning, moving, and editing of
planar geometries can be easier than corresponding operations on physical modeling
materials.


Gehry’s process introduces a number of problematic issues into this clean relationship
between physical and digital representations. Gehry’s design models also contain
imperfections of construction. However, unlike Euclidean geometries, established reference
formalisms that serve to define the “true” geometry behind the shape do not necessarily
exist. The geometry of the physical model provides the only definitive reference of design
intent that digital representations must strive to emulate.


Highly accurate digitizing technologies exist that can sample points in tight conformance with
physical objects. However, these representations still need to be cleaned up, to remove
imperfections in the physical object and to simplify digital geometry to a form that can be
manipulated. These operations introduce artifacts of the geometric representation underlying
the CAD system – representational constructs whose characteristics may be radically
different than those of the modeling materials. Distinctions between features of the physical
object that are desired and those that are model imperfections or noise are qualitative, and
must be undertaken through the filter of the CAD system’s geometric representation.


A closely related issue emerges in comparing the “user interfaces” afforded by physical and
digital modeling operations. Physical materials afford the development of certain forms,
guided by the behavior of materials and operations that are facilitated by these materials. In
the development of non-Euclidean geometries, these behaviors can be subtle and complex,
as materials are driven to deformation at the limits of their material behavior. These effects
generate formal qualities in the physical models important to the designers. The natural and
intuitive operations of designers operating on these physical objects can be difficult to even
approximately reproduce in digital form. As a result, either digital operations can result in
subtly but critically different geometries, or the development of shapes with similar qualities
can take substantial skill, time and attention by operators.

In Gehry’s architecture, the physical models
do not simply represent the geometry of the
project. Modeling materials and operations on
these      materials       have      a        certain
representational relationship to qualities of the
full scale materials and fabrication processes.
Digital modeling substitutes mathematically
founded    constructs     for   physically    based
processes. In the process of taking a form
                                                                   A. Digitized features
from physical model to physical construction
through the filter of digital representation,
elements of the physical correspondence that
binds model making to fabrication can be lost.
The development of digital constructs that
emulate and can retain these important
physical qualities are a core part of the firm’s
computing research, and are explored in
depth for specific materials and associated
processes in the latter parts of this thesis.                B. Digital “sketch” surface model


Despite the complexity of these issues,
relatively simple technology is at the heart of
the firms’ digitizing process. The firm has
relied on a FARO digitizing arm for the past
eight years. This device allows points to be
individually selected by the operator from the
model.    Segmented         polylines    can       be
generated by stringing sequences of these                    C. Prototyped confirmation model

sampled     points     together.   The       arm   is   Figure III-11: Digitized data, CAD model and
calibrated for each digitizing session so that                     prototyped model. (Ohr)

samples from physical models can be registered with existing digital representations in “full
scale” digital space. Many more elaborate digitizing technologies have been assessed over
the years, such as cloud of points digitizing capabilities used by the automotive and
animation industries. These technologies have until now been rejected due to practical

                                                                                                   70
limitations, including cost, speed, visual occlusion issues and problems with the capturing of
specific materials used in the firms’ physical models.


The geometry sampled from the physical models is relatively sparse (Figure III-11A). This
geometry captures critical features of the form to be observed in the digital reconstruction of
the geometry, rather than a comprehensive sampling of the physical form. Critical features of
the geometry vary depending on the material of the physical model. The edges between
intersecting surfaces are often the most important manifestations of the designers’ formal
intentions. These edges include both those representing breaks in the surface form between
surfaces of the model (shown in red in Figure III-11A), as well as the pattern of edges
between sheets forming a single surface shape. Intermediate curves representing the flow of
surfaces inside their boundaries are also captured to serve as guides for surface modeling
efforts. On surfaces constructed from paper and other sheet materials, straight lines of ruling
can be approximated from the surface material, shown in green in Figure III-11A.            The
geometric existence and implications of these features are discussed at length in Section
VI.B below.


On the basis of these digitized features, a CAD surface model is developed using
conventional NURBS modeling techniques (Figure III-11B). The result of this digitizing and
re-construction process represents a “sketch” of the project geometry. It is far from a final
representation, but rather serves as a background to the rest of the modeling process,
providing the medium for production activities that resolve the shape into constructible form.
Basic geometric operations such as closure of the surface into a “water tight” configuration
can only be performed in the idealized geometric environment afforded by computer
modeling.


The completed sketch model still represents a rudimentary representation of the building. It
mirrors the level of detail of the physical sketch models, and may represent only the exterior
envelope of the building. This digital sketch model will be in acceptable dimensional
conformance with the physical model, such that preliminary architectural development
exercises may be conducted relative to this digital artifact.


Verification models will be constructed from the CAD model so that designers can confirm
that digital project representation does not deviate significantly from the form of the physical

                                                                                             71
models.    Typically, “low tech” prototyping techniques are used by the firm to produce these
models. In early versions of the process, “pancake models” were the preferred method for
generating confirmation models. These models are made from layers of foam core, manually
cut from the digital surface model. Planar intersections of the geometry generate profiles for
these layers. The layers are manually cut from foam core, then re-assembled and glued
together, and finally sanded and finished. These solid representations of the surface form
can be physically modified by cutting into the foam core or layering on additional material.
These modifications are then re-digitized, and the digital surfaces modified to reflect the
changes.


As the process has developed and more intensive modeling operations are conducted earlier
in design, more detailed and accurate verification model generation processes have become
the norm. Frequently, verification models are now developed from intersecting sections of the
surface geometry, organized as a “jig saw” puzzle of parts representing orthogonal sections
though the surface geometry. These parts are developed in 3D as sections through the
exterior and interior surfaces of the project geometry. Cut outs are inserted to allow elements
to be connected together at their intersections. These parts are then flattened into 2D and cut
out using flat bed laser cutting. The parts are re-assembled into a spatial framework, then
covered with modeling materials (Figure III-11C). This process both allows a tighter
conformance to the project geometry than the pancake method, and provides a model
supporting the definition of both exterior and interior surfaces.


Occasionally, more elaborate technologies are drawn on, both for digitizing and prototyping.
Layered object manufacturing (LOM, Figure IV-5), stereo lithography and material deposition
(Figure III-17) techniques have been used on various projects. However, these techniques
have important implications on the qualities of the resulting models, both in the forms
produced and the modeling materials compatible with these techniques. Although these
techniques result in models that are highly accurate dimensional representations of the
digital models, they remove aspects of fabrication process from the model generation
process, and rely on materials that may not retain qualities of either the generating physical
models or the final fabrication methods. These prototyping techniques have typically been
reserved for project elements whose ultimate fabrication materials are either molded
materials such as concrete, or relatively free form fabric materials such as fiberglass or other
composites.

                                                                                             72
More elaborate digitizing techniques have been attempted when the physical model would
prohibit use the firm’s feature digitizing and reconstruction process. CAT scanning of physical
models was used on the flower sculpture on the DCH project95, where the form and
complexity of the physical model would have prohibited feature sampling using a digitizing
arm (Figure III-12).

The digital project models are developed in
parallel with physical design modeling. At the
end of design development, there exists a
master physical model of the project and a
corresponding digital model that are the in tight
dimensional        correspondence        and    together
represent     the     master      project      geometric
representations. The digital model is then
carried forward through to construction. If there
are changes to the geometry required to
address construction issues, these changes
will be made to both the physical and digital
master models.


As the design progresses in its definition of
constructibility    intentions,    the    relationships    Figure III-13: The physical master model and its
                                                                        digital counterpart (MIT)
between physical and digital elements take on
new forms. The integration becomes less concerned with the capabilities of digital
representation to capture form, and rather to come to an understanding of issues of
constructibility. Gehry projects often adopt fabrication systems that have no exact precedent,
and apply these systems to forms for which the full impact of geometry on fabrication can not
easily be anticipated. Often building performance codes and analytical methods have been
developed with the assumption of more conventional geometric conditions. Physical
mockups of building systems provide valuable information for their development.




                                                                                                        74
Schematic      level      studies        of     potential
construction systems are conducted in both
physical and digital form early in the design
process. The level of detail of early systems
exploration is intentionally limited. These
studies may serve to test the feasibility of a
system strategy, and provide a vehicle for
communication with partnering organizations
Figure III-14 shows examples of schematic
physical and digital structural studies.


Larger scale physical mockups may be
constructed    of      portions     of    the    project
geometry, and clad using potential materials of
the final construction. These early mockups
identify qualities of construction materials that
may impact the aesthetic qualities of the
                                                            Figure III-14: Schematic design phase physical
project. During early design development,                              and digital structural studies
these mockups are constructed by the firm’s
internal modeling resources, and the actual
correspondence to the final systems – in terms of fabrication or assembly components – is
limited. Rather, the mock-ups at this point are utilized to explore the qualities of potential
construction materials, and to expose some of the relationships between fabrication
methodologies and the qualities of the shapes that are being considered. The full system
detailing may not be employed; these mockups serve simply to test whether the assumptions
about the relationship between project geometry and finish material qualities are valid. One
main consideration to be tested is whether the finish system can actually assume the form
specified in the digital model without warping, cracking or localized distortion around
fasteners.


Later mockups become more elaborate. Fully detailed digital studies are conducted of small
portions of the project, to fully test system detailing strategies in the CAD environment.
These studies are conducted on selected portions of the project deemed representative of
typical geometric conditions. These digital mockups are developed to a level of detail where

                                                                                                        75
the      organization         of
components – and special
cases that may result from
the    deployment        of    a
selected building system –
can be understood. Issues
identified in these selected
portions of the facility will be
extrapolated to the rest of
the project. The level of
detail undertaken will be up
to that which would suggest
that full completion of shop
drawings        could         be
undertaken.     Figure    III-15                Figure III-15: “Digital Mockup” studies
                                          of cladding systems, Kiva element, Stata Center
shows design development
phase digital mockups of several approaches to the construction of the “Kiva” element of the
MIT Stata Center project. This element was considered to represent the geometry and
construction of several areas of the project.


Ultimately, full scale performance mockups may be constructed to allow full engineering
testing of proposed building systems. These mockups test the full digital – physical
construction process of the design and construction teams, including hand offs of geometric
information. These mockups are typically developed for cladding systems to allow full
engineering testing. Tests may include structural and wind loading performance, water
penetration, and response to frame racking that might occur as a result of seismic events.
Figure III-16 shows an example from the Disney Concert Hall project, in which a performance
mockup was developed using the actual geometry of a small corner of the project from the
project master model. This geometry served as the basis for developing a mockup
comprising three major cladding systems: the typical cladding system, skylights and vertical
glazing. The mockup was subjected to testing under simulated wind and rain conditions, in
initial state as well as after frame racking was imposed.

F.     RATIONALIZATION
The concept of rationalization is at the heart of Gehry Partner’s computing and construction
methodologies. Broadly stated, rationalization is the resolution of rules of constructibility into
project geometry. The concept encompasses broad applications in the firm’s process. Many
of these applications can have substantial impact on the formal qualities and design intent of
the project architecture. Others can have dramatic effects on the cost and control of
construction, and hence can determine the feasibility of building strategies.


This issue of problem description through mathematics and geometry, and the fitness of a
mathematical / geometric model to a given solution approach is of course nothing new in
engineering and physics applications. In Gehry’s building process, geometric representation
and its role in providing the syntax for describing the project design intent, and supporting its
translation into constructibility and building intentions deserves some inspection.


Mitchell makes reference to the role of rationalization on constructibility decisions in his
comparison of the Sydney Opera House and Guggenheim Bilbao projects57. The Sydney
Opera House (1957-73) designed and constructed just before the advent of digital geometric
modeling, required the designed form to be rationalized into spherical elements simply to be
describable using contemporary drafting and engineering methods. With the advent of digital
curved surface modeling, these limitations on designer’s descriptive capabilities seem to
have largely been addressed. However, experience by the firm indicates issues of project
description and geometric constraints are still very much in play.


Simply the operation of rendering a physical shape into digital form implies a structuring
through the geometric representations of the CAD application. A broad palette geometric
forms with various characteristics – one, two or three dimensional, Euclidean or other
differentiable forms – are available to serve as representational bases for the surface
geometry or any other element of the building. Selection of a set of geometric elements as a
basis for the digital representation in itself imbues the digital description with certain
characteristics. In the process of rendering the project design surface into digital form,
variations between the shapes produced by physical modeling and that produced through
digitizing occur. This is not so much due to any specific, substantial deviation in the sampling
of geometry, but rather more subtly due to the qualities of the smoothing functions embodied

                                                                                               78
in NURBS representations, relative to that
provided by physical materials. NURBS
modeling tends to produce a more uniformly
varying   surface   smoothness.     Localized
variations of the surface form generated
through the forming of physical materials
are lost in the process. Slight imperfections
of the model geometry need to be “fixed” in
order to close the project surface into a tight
form. Loss of these nuances of form is
                                                  Figure III-17: Physical model rationalized by digital
apparent to the project designers, and the                             modeling

control of form as it passes between physical and digital representations is of substantial
concern in design phase. While certainly digital modeling represents a vast improvement
over traditional drafting methods in capturing non-Euclidean design forms, qualities of these
digital geometric representations still have an impact on the description of forms.


The impact of geometric representation on project form is more apparent when
representational constructs associated with fabrication are considered. The notion of
congruence between a geometric representational form and the requirements of a system
may seem unfamiliar on the basis of “conventional” construction. However, such decisions
are made, even if standard conventions of project documentation make these decisions
seem implicit. In conventional framing, a stud seems to be naturally described by one form:
that of a line or linear extrusion. However, different views of the project (plans, sections,
details) are based on other geometric constructs. Within these disparate representations,
even a simple object such as a stud might assume a variety of geometric forms.


In the documentation of Gehry’s forms, the issues involved in selecting geometric
representations for project elements is more readily apparent. Numerous mathematical forms
are available for representing curved objects in space. Each of these approaches introduces
a de facto set of constraints on the shapes that can be represented. The activity of selecting
a digital representation for spatial system components – in congruence with the physical
constraints on the fabrication of these components – is a core aspect of the rationalization
process


                                                                                                    79
One motivation for rationalization efforts is ultimately project cost, reflected in the unit costs
of available fabrication and construction systems. Fabrication efficiencies can pose
substantial constraints on project geometry. Building systems come with rules or constraints
that have direct bearing on the qualities of forms that can be accommodated. Low cost
systems may highly constrain the forms that can be produced. Many contemporary
fabrication processes rely on equipment geared toward the generation of Euclidean shapes:
straight line break cutting and sawing, bending of extrusions to arc shapes on spindles.
Alternatively, construction methodologies with great degrees of flexibility can represent
prohibitive unit costs. Where competitive CNC enabled processes offering support of fully
curved geometries exist, these processes often imply fabrication costs that would overwhelm
reasonable construction budgets. Engineering and performance criteria can impose
constraints on eccentricities in geometric positioning even if curved geometries can be
fabricated.


In Gehry’s work, new construction systems are frequently developed to support specific
project forms. However, these systems will necessarily bring formal and organizational
requirements that can require some modification of the project forms. The project design
development and associated systems engineering strategies must be able to accommodate
these requirements individually, and negotiate between the geometric impacts of differing
systems’ requirements as they interact. Computer modeling is the principal medium through
which this geometric rationalization occurs. Digital project descriptions are the design
artifacts in which detailed dimensional descriptions occur, where heuristics regarding the
behavior of the design geometry can be made, where geometric rules organizing project
elements can be represented, and where tools exist to perform operations that can bring
project elements into conformance with these rules.


The identification of appropriate geometric constructs for a given system is fundamental to
the development and deployment of building systems that support complex geometry. At
best, if there is a tight conformance between the construction constraints of the system and
the constraints of the geometric construct, simply generating shapes with this geometric
construct guarantees constructibility of the shapes. Computational tools may be developed to
support a rapid and intuitive generation of shapes based on the selected geometric form. The
underlying logic presented by the geometric form – and its synergy with that of the
construction system - may be drawn on to support automation of descriptive activities.

                                                                                               80
Consideration of these geometric and system decisions is ideally begun early in design,
while the initial gestures of the project are still being developed. These rules, representing
both formal and practical qualities of proposed systems, are developed in collaboration with
engineers and fabricators. The development of system rules and operations occurs along a
similar time line to that of the project form. Initially, only general notions of the selected
systems and their associated constraints may be understood. This initial understanding may
influence the selection of materials to be used during physical model explorations. The
design’s formal and system decisions are refined together as the project develops. A tighter
level of understanding of the qualities of the design form the basis of more detailed system
strategies, which in turn present more specific rules for the spatial organization of the project.


A simple example serves to illustrate the point. Many building systems used on Gehry’s
projects involve components whose shapes are curves generated from planar intersections
with the design surface or offsets of this surface. This curve will derive the structuring of its
geometric description from the intersected surface, typically a NURBS curve from a NURBS
surface (Section V.D.3). This curve is smoothly and continuously varying in shape and
curvature.


For much of the project, the element may remain represented in the master model in this
original geometric description as a simple planar curve in space, even as details of its
performance, materials and fabrication are being defined. The structural frame may be
carried in the master model through to construction documents simply as a wireframe. During
shop drawing production and fabrication, the geometry of the elements’ descriptions will
likely need to be refined. Economies of fabrication may dictate that performance criteria for
the system can be satisfied most economically through systems which impose some
constraints on the geometry of elements, relative to ideal curve generated from the model
geometry.


Often, these smooth planar curves are ultimately rationalized into sequences of Euclidean
sub-elements, either straight lines, constant curvature arc segments, or some combination of
the two. Rationalization of curves into line segments is straightforward (Figure III-21B). A set
of points on the curve is selected through some criteria; these points are joined together by
line segments. This simple segmentation has obvious correlations to fabrication applications

                                                                                               81
(Figure III-18), and fairly obvious impacts on the
tolerance of the resulting system relative to the
ideal geometry expressed by the input curve.
Segmented members can be constructed out of
extruded profiles, including I beams or custom
channels. The selection of segmentation points
can be dictated by a number of criteria,
including connection relations to other project Figure III-18: Segmented construction of planar
                                                                            curves (DCH)
geometry,    maximum       or    minimum          efficient
material    lengths,   angle     criteria,    maximum
distance deviation from the ideal curve, etc.
These fabrication efficiencies can be expressed
as   geometric     rules   and     encoded        in   the
segmentation strategy. Numerous systems on
Gehry projects have employed this geometric
rationalization    strategy,     driven      by    widely
different fabrication criteria and corresponding
geometric rules.

segmentation approach from the perspective of constructibility. Segmentation produces
angles between segments; which will cause kinks in the system that may disadvantageously
affect the architectural form. The resulting angles may need to be resolved through
complicated beveled connections. The deviation between the ideal curve and the linear
segments can result in conflicts with other systems. Of course, the deviation can be
controlled by increasing the number of segments, but this will also increase the number of
parts and connections, which can drive up the cost of fabrication.


A second approach, used on several projects, rationalizes planar curves into sequences of
arc segments, with tangency constraints imposed between the segments (Figure III-19). This
can ameliorate some of the limitations of the linear segmentation strategy above. The
connections between elements will be smooth, so no kinking of the system or the resulting
connections results. The relationship between number of segments and deviation from the
design curve is improved. Of course, bending material into an arc is likely to be more

                                                                                                       82
expensive than leaving it straight, but the in reduction of the number of connections, and the
resolution of connection geometry into straight connections can more than justify the
expense of curving material.


Figure III-21C illustrates the geometry of this rationalization approach. Two points on the
design curve – and the corresponding tangents to the curve at the points – are provided as
input to the rationalization. These input location + tangent vector pairs can be joined through
a biarc – two arcs joined in tangency97. In fact, a given input point / tangent pair generates a
one parameter family of biarcs. Within this family of biarcs, the arc pair closest to the input
curve can be determined by optimization. If the deviation between this optimal biarc and the
input curve is outside of the desired tolerance for the system, the approach can be
recursively applied by selecting a point somewhere in the middle of the design curve. The
biarc solution can be applied to each of these ranges, resulting in a total of four arc segments
(Figure III-21D). The process can be repeated recursively until a satisfactory solution is
achieved.


In pipe bending, fabrication requirements have sometimes suggested including a straight line
connection of pre-determined length between adjoining arcs (Figure III-21E). The reason for
this is that the bending equipment can not bend the material all the way to its ends; a ”grip”
section is required at the termination of the pipe bend. The rationalization strategy can be
amended to accommodate this requirement by first casting a biarc over the curve as
described above, then “backing off” the curve along lines of tangency at the ends and the
biarc connection the required distance from both ends, and finally constructing arc segments
from these new points.


Figure III-21F shows this approach on a study
of   the    Weatherhead   pipe   system.   The
recursive biarc optimization algorithm, along
with minimal straight line joining segments,
was developed into a custom geometric
modeling program. The program includes
automation of dimensioning on arcs and
straight segments of interest to the pipe
bending fabricator.                                  Figure III-20: Curved, planar pipe system

This example presents a quite simple application of rationalization methods to the fairly
simple geometry of planar curves. Even in this context, it is apparent that differences in the
designs of building systems can profoundly affect the strategy of geometric representation.
The rationalization algorithms described above are substantially deterministic. Given a planar
curve, a geometry rationalization algorithm embodying constructibility rules can be identified
through which successful solution can usually be guaranteed.


Rationalization considerations can become substantially more complex when system
organizations move “off the plane” to full three dimensional spatial organizations. Additional
degrees of freedom imposed on problems of geometric elements in 3D space can quickly
render such deterministic solution strategies unachievable, or at least introduce geometries
with more complicated fabrication requirements. This is illustrated in the development of
global structural strategies on Gehry projects. A variety of primary structural systems have
been employed; we compare two relatively typical approaches on the Experience Music
Project and the Walt Disney Concert Hall, both projects with a primary structural strategy
developed around a steel frame (Figure III-22).


A basic difference can be detected in the geometry of the structural scheme employed on
these two projects – a distinction that represents an extension of the rationalization
operations discussed in the above example. DCH represents a more “conventional” braced
steel frame constructed from straight stick steel extrusions. These extruded members are
formed from conventional AISC steel sections1 – predominately I beam and column sections.


AISC section steel is mass produced by commercial steel mills, and represent a quite
economical “raw material” for construction. However, in order to approximate the curved
surface geometry of the DCH surface, the structural frame presents a “tessellation” of the
curved surface geometry. A relatively tightly framed grid of columns and beams –
approximately 10’ on center – was required to accommodate the curved surface geometry to
tight enough tolerances. This relatively fine grain tessellation of the frame geometry results in
a relatively large number of connections between primary structural elements.




                                                                                              85

More importantly, the geometry of these
connections    is   relatively   complicated.
Members       do    not    frame      together
orthogonally, requiring difficult end bevels
and complicated plate and clip assemblies
(Figure III-23). The number and complexity
of member connections has made the steel
frame on DCH a difficult and expensive
detailing job, offsetting the benefits of using
straight, stock section members.                    Figure III-23: Connection geometry on DCH


The frame design of the Experience Music Project takes a radically different approach66. The
structural strategy results from plate built ribs, essentially curved I beams built up from
custom cut plate elements. The frame is initially laid out as intersections between the design
surface and a pattern of parallel, vertically oriented planes, spaced 10’ on center The
resulting planar curves are offset inward 24” from the finish surface to accommodate the
curtain wall system (described in detail in Section IX.A below). Finite element modeling by
the engineer (Skilling, Ward, Magnussun, and Barkshire) determined the necessary stiffness
for each rib. On the basis of these performance criteria, the depth of the I-beam profile was
determined for each rib. These depths were reflected in the CAD model of the system by
simply offsetting the external curve of the rib the calculated distance.


In some highly curved areas of the structure, exactly following the planar intersection curve
of the surface form would have imposed excessively tight curvatures in the rib profile. These
curved regions would have disrupted the load path through the curve, producing excessive
bending forces. In these highly shaped areas, the rib geometry was rationalized further,
bringing the rib geometry away from the surface. The deviation between the surface and the
rib was accommodated through additional secondary steel.




                                                                                                87

In the EMP system, a fully curved edge representation was retained through to fabrication.
The curves were brought into AutoCAD, re-oriented, and flattened in 2D for shop drawing
detailing. Curves defining the boundary of each rib’s web were created, then sent to plasma
cutting equipment (Figure III-24A). In a second step (Figure III-24B), the edge curves were
passed to a custom built CNC plate rolling machine, which rolled plate steel for the top and
bottom flanges of the ribs into shape.


Rationalization operations can be required simply as a consequence of the collaborative
computational process. Translations from the NURBS surface based CATIA environment to
other trade specific software applications can necessitate rationalization of the form
described, just to achieve continuity of process. Currently, few of the steel analysis and
detailing applications available accept curved elements. Finite element structural analysis
programs still typically require linear elements for solution. While rationalized FEA models
are not usually transferred directly to fabrication modeling, these linearized formats have

                                                                                             88
become the standard translation format for
most   steel    translation.        New    additions    to
                               51
standards such as SDNF              allow the translation
of elements comprised of constant curvature
arc segments (Figure III-19). This enhancement
of translation format still dictates rationalization
of curved geometry into arc segments.

It should not be surprising that the toughest
rationalization problems on Gehry’s projects
often derive from the fabrication of the surface
envelope itself. The qualities of materials, and
potential efficiencies in fabricating enclosure
systems guided by material properties again
present a wide range of geometric constructs,
and    constraints    on       the      geometry       and
architectural   intent     determined        by    these
constructs. The rationalization of surface forms
adds another level of complexity to the digital
process. Considerable attention will be paid to

G.      MODEL INTELLIGENCE, AUTOMATION, AND PARAMETRICS
Substantial operator effort is involved in developing detailed system geometry in 3D CAD
form. Since the geometry of each system element is often unique on Gehry projects,
substantial repetitive geometric operations are required to instantiate the description of
system elements. This level of effort, coupled with the cost of relatively high priced CAD
operator labor, can have a significant impact on design and detailing costs. Furthermore, the
project geometry is often in flux well into design development. The product of modeling effort
invested early in the process can need to be reworked as changes to project geometry occur.
On the other hand, building system development often requires studies of system geometry


                                                                                                       89
to be conducted to some level of detail early in design, to ensure that system strategies
address varying local geometric conditions. These issues of modeling effort have been
addressed in the firm’s process in several ways. Earlier in the development of the firm’s
digital process, virtually all CAD modeling was deferred until late in the design process, when
the project designers had “closed” or finalized the building form. Prior to that point, only
digital sketch models – rough surface models corresponding to the basic form of the physical
models – were developed, usually only to provide geometry for cut extraction associated with
specific document packages.


A general decline in the cost of computer modeling hardware, software and labor has
allowed greater application of digital modeling earlier in the design process. However, issues
of labor associated with large scale instantiation of system component definitions persist.
The costs associated with this effort are partly addressed by limiting the level of detail of
component geometric representations, and by performing detailed system studies or “digital
mockups” on only small portions of the project geometry.


The dual goals of increasing efficiency of 3D digital documentation efforts, and supporting re-
use of this information as variations in the building form occur, have been topics of research
and development efforts by the firm and its partners. Much of this work as been centered
around the development of procedural CAD modeling scripts to automate repetitive geometry
generation tasks. Often a simple geometric operation requires several intermediate
constructions to produce the required geometry. These operations are typically performed
relative to some existing geometry of the model. Scripting of these tasks can reduce the time
required to generate geometric descriptions of building components. For example,
commercially available steel detailing packages such as X-Steel and SDS-2 provide macros
for the generation of categories of steel connections. These macros perform cut backs, fillets,
bolt holes, and other difficult geometric operations on steel members in 3D form, in addition
to placing plates, clip angles and other connection components. Unfortunately, these
applications have often been shown to make orthogonality and other geometric assumptions
that do not necessarily hold on Gehry project geometry. These macros have required re-
coding to support the geometric conditions in the firm’s projects.


Sophisticated fabricators have developed their own programs to support the automation of
repetitive geometric tasks during shop drawing generation. One example, A. Zahner

                                                                                            90
Company’s Automated Panel Layout Application (ZAPLA), is described in Section IX.A
below.


While these examples of procedural or scripted automation provide an element of modeling
efficiency, they can not address requirements for updating information in response to
changes in project geometry. The geometric scripts and any associated manual interactions
must be re-applied on any modified input geometry. Toward the goal of addressing this
limitation of scripted approaches to automation, the firm has recently begun intensive efforts
to incorporate parametric technology into its digital process.


Parametric technology allows relationships among geometric elements to be encoded in the
model as part of operations on these elements. For example, when a curve is generated as
the intersection of a surface and a plane in space, the nature of this curve as a geometric
relationship between the surface and plane is retained in its digital description. Changes to
the input geometry – by modifying the surface or moving the plane - will flag an update and
regeneration of the curve. Variables may be included in the descriptions of geometries;
changes to the values of these variables can also be used to trigger updates of geometry.


Parametric modeling capabilities have existed in commercial applications for more than a
decade. The technology has been the focus of architectural computing research in describing
design typologies55. However, until recently, these applications were unmanageably slow for
large scale geometric models. Furthermore, the user interface requirements for generating
geometric associations between elements were unwieldy. The mathematical models
underlying curved object representations add substantial computational requirements to the
geometric description of objects, further slowing the updating of models.


Parametric technology has had substantial application in mechanical design applications,
where changes to product definitions can be limited to dimensional variations of the product.
Marc Burry’s efforts to develop parametrically based models of elements on the Sagrada
Familia construction project over the last ten years15 provide a notable example of the
application of parametrics in an architectural setting.


Recent improvements in the user interfaces to parametric modeling applications, and the
inexorable advances in computational power, seem to have finally brought applications of

                                                                                            91
fully parametric modeling within the horizon of building construction applications. A pilot
project to develop a fully parametric master model for the Museum of Tolerance (MOT)
project was begun in January 2002, using Dassault Systèmes’ most recent release of the
CATIA product, Version 5. This initiative has produced promising results, although not
without difficulties. One example from the project illustrates the potential of parametric
approaches to constructibility issues.


Gehry Partners is currently collaborating with the engineering office of Schlaich Bergermann
and Partner on the development of a free glass roof covering the atria of the Museum of
Tolerance project. Several Gehry projects have included large curved surface elements
comprised of triangular facets, including the DG Bank Headquarters skylight, a previous
collaboration between the firms (Figure IV-2), and the entry façade of the Guggenheim
Bilbao museum (Figure III-25).


A curved surface can be rationalized into an
assembly     of     triangular   facets   with   little
difficulty. However, prior experience with large
glazed roof structures by the engineer (Figure
III-26)   has       suggested    great    economic
advantage to constructing these structures
from compositions of rectangular, as opposed
to    triangular,     glazing     elements.      This
requirement, while beneficial from a cost
standpoint, imposes a substantial constraint              Figure III-26: Curved surface glazed roof (Berlin
                                                               Zoo, Schlaich Bergermann & Partner)
on forms that can be constructed. While any
surface can be tessellated into a closed composition of triangular faces, the surfaces that can
be covered with a quadrilateral tessellation are highly constrained to configurations whose
characteristics are not immediately obvious.


Independent study of the problem by both firms has identified the class of translation
surfaces18, which adhere to the geometric constraints necessary to allow quadrilateral
tessellation. These are surfaces generated by a curve (the generatrix curve), swept in space
without rotation along the path of a second curve (the directrix). It can be demonstrated that
points, invariantly positioned along the resulting family of curves, can be joined by facets that

                                                                                                        92
are necessarily both quadrilateral and flat.
Figure   III-27   shows    elements     of   this
construction. The vectors A (equivalently B)
can be shown to be uniformly parallel,
guaranteeing that a face lofted between any
successive pair of these vectors is necessarily
planar. This class of translation surfaces can
be further extended by allowing the generatrix
                                                     Figure III-27: Construction of the translation
curve to be scaled as it is translated along the                       surface
directrix. While certainly not all forms can be generated as translation surfaces, there is
considerable freedom to the set of surfaces that can be described or closely approximated by
a surface of this construction.


The translation surface construction solves the problem of defining surfaces that can be
approximated with quadrilateral tessellations. However, the generation of these surfaces
requires a number of intermediate geometric constructions.             Using conventional CAD
approaches, the geometry must be re-constructed each time the generating curves are
modified. This presents a substantial impediment to the interactive design of translation
surfaces.


Parametric technologies allow these geometric operations to be encapsulated into a
persistent, “intelligent” translation surface object that retains the structuring of its geometric
construction. The inputs to, or handles on, this object are the generatrix and directrix curves,
and a third curve that establishes the scaling of the genetrix as it is translated along the
directrix. This dramatically simplifies the construction and modification of the surfaces, while
still guaranteeing adherence to the constructibility constraints. Figure III-28 shows elements
of this parametric construction, results of editing the surface by manipulating the input
curves, and the resulting planar quadrilateral composition. It is anticipated that many of the
firm’s constructibility problems can be attacked through similar definitions of parametric
objects, which encapsulate the intelligence necessary to solve the given problem.

More limited applications of associating intelligence with project geometry have been
employed by the firm for some time. Various mechanisms exist for associating non-geometric
or “semantic” information with geometry. Layering and coloring constructs ubiquitous in CAD
applications provide a trivial example of such capabilities. The establishment of project
layering and coloring standards is a simple but important element of the master model
definition. These standards are included in the project specifications and annotated in
schedules on the two dimensional project documents. Maintenance of this attribute
information during translation between the various CAD applications on the project is an
important and not necessarily trivial aspect of the firm’s computational process development
in general, and an element of the collaborative computational process developed with any
new project partner.


One limitation of layering schemes for supporting model semantic information is that layer
information represents only one “axis” or field for such information. There are many non
geometric aspects of elements’ definition on a project that may be of interest, and that should
be included in the project description along side geometry. These attributes may exist in
many permutations. For example, on the Disney Concert Hall (Figure III-22B), attributes
tracked in the structural steel wireframe model included primary vs. secondary steel, cardinal
point (top of steel, center, etc.), steel grade, finish (galvanized, architectural finish quality),
curved vs. straight elements, and provisional vs. released for construction. Each valid
permutation of these attributes had to be tracked as a unique layer. While this scheme
worked on this limited application, the strategy is not scalable as the number of systems and
associated attributes in the master model are increased.


During the past three years, more advanced mechanisms for tracking of attributes have been
attempted. CATIA V4 provides capabilities for developing attribute schema, named variables
with defined values associated to the variable. The variables can be instantiated on any
geometric object in the project master model. Queries can be run to identify elements of the
project geometry with selected attribute combinations (Figure III-29A, B).


Similar capabilities provide support for associating attributes of structural steel elements with
geometry. Attributes such as section profile, cardinal point, and material properties may be
tied to a parametric description of structural elements’ position in space (Figure III-29C, D).


                                                                                                  95
These developments promise to eventually achieve the firm’s vision for an intelligent, fully
integrated digital database of all project information. To date, this integration has been
achieved by a mix of automated integration with substantial amounts of operator effort and
project manager diligence. The scale and variety of information to be tracked on a project
through its development presents an enormous computational task. Project information is not
completely coherent until well into design development or construction documentation
phases. Often, known conflicts or omissions of design information are carried in the project
until the information necessary for resolution of these gaps in the information are available.
Project designers can accommodate an ambiguity of information that might be difficult for an
integrated database to process. Nonetheless, the firm’s digital process and technologies
offer elements of what can be imaged to be the future of digitally integrated project
information.

In Part 1 of this thesis, issues in the development of Gehry’s Partners’ building delivery
process and associated computing methodologies were presented. Important relationships
between the representation of project geometry and the operations of fabrication and
construction were introduced. The concept of rationalization was introduced, through which
requirements of constructibility are interpreted into geometric constraints on the project form.
Examples of rationalizing geometric strategies were discussed in relationship to the building
systems on which they have been applied.


While these issues impact the development of all building systems on Gehry projects, the
most profound impacts are realized in the development of projects’ exterior surface forms,
and the corresponding building envelope systems that ultimately realize these forms. This
exterior project geometry sets the stage for all subsequent constructibility strategies. It is
here that subtleties of geometric interpretation can have the most profound consequences on
the aesthetic qualities of the project.


The variety of geometric forms presented in Gehry’s works eludes the development of a
comprehensive taxonomy. However, in the body of work being developed by Gehry’s firm at
the current point of writing, there are a set of qualities which are identifiable and largely
unique to Gehry’s work: the smoothly curved surfaces which create the energetic, undulating
forms on many projects. In these shapes there exists an important set of common building
intentions, unified by similar approaches to the manipulation of surface materials, and guided
by a common set of constructibility constraints and associated economies. The research
presented in the remainder of this thesis is directed toward a geometric analysis of these
forms, toward the goal of supporting the definition of constructibility requirements in
computational form.


This discussion focuses on the set of shapes constructed from sheet materials, shaped in
space without large scale material deformations that would require forming through molding
or stamping. These shapes have been termed paper surfaces by members of the firm. The
term “paper surface” is employed in this thesis in a deliberately pre-analytic and evocative
sense, to reflect the wide range of formal and tectonic issues embodied in this class of
shapes. Other more formal terms will be employed to characterize specific geometric
constructs within this general class of surface forms.

This section is introduced through a qualitative survey of the surface geometries and
associated formal, material and constructibility issues of Gehry’s projects, provided in
Chapter IV. Following this introduction, a review of the mathematical foundations of
differential geometry underlying the description of curved spatial forms is provided. This
mathematical foundation forms the basis for the definition of specific representational
constructs supporting the description of paper surface forms. The definition of these
constructs is provided in Chapters VI and VII, along with examples of their application to the
definition of constructibility requirements on the firm’s past and current projects.

IV. Materiality and its Geometric Representations

The previous chapters described the relationships between constraints on project forms
introduced by economies and methods of fabrication, and corresponding constraints on the
physical and digital representations of these forms. In Gehry’s process, these constraints are
represented in parallel: through the selection of physical modeling materials in the
construction of scale models, and the selection of digital elements, defined by specific
geometric constructs. We may consider the confluence of these physical, digital and
fabrication constraints to define a class of surface forms.


It is possible to view the historical progression of Gehry’s built projects as a progressive
development of these classes of surface forms. The possibility of building the ambitious
geometries exhibited in Gehry’s recent work did not occur spontaneously. Rather, one can
witness in his work the progressive development of an increasingly ambitious geometric
vocabulary, beginning with the fairly conventional forms of his early commercial and
residential projects, through to the extreme geometric forms of the Experience Music Project.
Each project pushes the successful precedents and experiences developed on prior projects
to new limits. On contemporary projects, Gehry often includes elements with geometries
reminiscent of previous projects, as well as elements with ambitious extensions of prior
geometries and, occasionally, elements for which no particular precedent yet exists.
Corresponding to this formal development is a progressive development of engineering,
fabrication and digital description techniques. While the progression of Gehry’s gestural
intentions may be difficult to decipher over the distance of time, the development of the
underlying geometry can be discerned directly from the traditional and digital representations
that document his works.



A.     PLANAR SURFACES
The point of departure for this inquiry into classes of surface forms is the simplest and most
obvious such class, embodied by planar surfaces. The basis for physical modeling of these
surfaces are rigid sheet materials such as foam core or stiff cardboard, which may easily be
formed into planar shapes. One can inquire what the geometric limits of these physical
materials are. Non-planar shapes such as spheres or other curved surfaces are of course
inappropriate for modeling with flat foam core. There are ways that this can be done, by
                                                                                          101
cutting and stacking, or wetting the material to achieve a paper-mache quality. But
undertaking these activities using rigid flat materials seems to be qualitatively different than
simply cutting out a piece of rigid material and positioning it in space. One may capture this
observation as a rule regarding the behavior of stiff sheet materials, that “rigid sheet
materials enable - and are constrained to - planar geometries”. As one works with rigid
materials in scale, it is possible to “read through” the behavior of these modeling materials
and to infer that, by working with these materials in an appropriate fashion, one is guided by
these materials’ spatial behaviors to produce shapes within a vocabulary of planar forms.


Having built in model form an assembly of planar objects, one may have reasonable
confidence that the assembly may be constructed using certain real world construction
systems. There are of course a wide variety of construction systems supporting planar forms,
from stud framing to glass curtain walls to concrete formwork. The economical deployment of
these fabrication systems again suggests their application to, or enables, the construction of
planar surface geometries. Notably, from the perspective of geometric performance, planar
modeling materials may be used interchangeably to represent any of these construction
systems. Although one may choose foam core of various thicknesses to represent concrete
block or stud framing construction, or plexiglass to represent glazing systems, this selection
impacts the perceptual fidelity with their represented constructions, not any further geometric
conditioning on the modeled forms imposed by these materials. In extending this discussion
to other geometric forms, this simplicity of geometric equivalence among physical modeling
representations will no longer necessarily be the case.


Simple, precise mathematical descriptions exist for these Euclidean geometries, conducive
to formulation in digital modeling applications. There are in fact multiple such descriptions. A
plane in three dimensional space can be described as a relationship between three points in
space, as a relationship between two intersecting lines or vectors, or through an implicit
function of four variables14. A plane may be completely described by – and is “dual to” – a
specially chosen point in space10. Each of these representations affords particular utility to
specific geometric operations. However, these representations are equivalent, in the sense
that we can translate between them explicitly; no loss of geometric information is incurred
through this translation.




                                                                                            102
With the definition of this basic class of planar constructible forms in hand, one can begin to
explore the limits of forms that respect the constraints of planar geometry. In typical
construction, planar forms are organized orthogonally: vertical, perpendicular walls,
horizontal floors. We may consider geometries of such orthogonally positioned planar
elements to be a more highly constrained subclass of the general planar surface class. There
are various fabrication and engineering efficiencies afforded by adoption this further
restriction on geometries. Eccentric loading conditions are largely eliminated on vertical
walls. Detailing of connections between orthogonally positioned wall and floor systems is
simplified.


On conventional framed construction, pitched roofs provide an exception to the conventions
of orthogonal, planar construction, and establish a precedent for the exploration of more
ambitious planar forms. The geometry and corresponding detailing of hip or gable roof
forms63 is somewhat more complicated and expensive than that of the floors and walls below,
but the documentation, engineering and fabrication associated with these geometries is well
established in conventional wood frame construction practice.


Gehry’s early works demonstrate precisely this exploration. The radical proposition or
“violence”21 of this early work is precisely in its demonstration that conventional, industrial
materials and constructions could generate unconventional forms, applied unconventionally
to non-industrial architectural programs. Along the way, the economies associated with this
relatively conventional geometry and associated fabrication efficiencies are realized42.


These geometries have persisted on elements of Gehry’s more recent projects, even as his
geometric vocabulary has expanded. Partly, this is a result of a budgetary strategy employed
on Gehry’s designs. These geometries remain inexpensive to construct, relative to the more
recent additions to the vocabulary of geometric forms. Judicious use of conventional
construction in concert with less constrained geometries has allowed the firm to meet project
programmatic requirements within allocated budgets.




                                                                                           103

In geometric terms, these planar forms are a highly constrained class of surfaces. This fact is
evident by the trivial simplicity of its mathematical description. We can posit a metric for the
freedom – or lack there of – of a class of surface forms by regarding the degrees of freedom
in their mathematical descriptions. Planes in three dimensional space can be fully specified
by three real numbers; the permutations of these three variables describe the positions of
every possible plane in space. Of course, this is still an infinite set of potential configurations,
and this representation does not take into account the possible configurations of boundaries
that provide additional possibilities for planar forms. The simplicity – and rigidity - of this
mathematical constraint system has a direct correlation with the both the simplicity and the
geometric limitations of the corresponding fabrication systems.



B.     “FREE FORM” SURFACES
At the opposite end of the geometric / constructibility spectrum, one can identify free form,
virtually unconstrained surface geometries and associated fabrication methods. We may

                                                                                               104
construct scale physical models from materials that may be formed in an almost completely
unencumbered fashion, such as one might do with clay. Here we are free to form virtually
any shape, including the planar shapes enabled by rigid materials. Note, however, that
smoothly planar forms are actually more difficult to form using clay than they are using rigid
materials, where the planar forms are “at hand” in the form of the raw materials themselves.
The freedom enabled by clay like materials seems disadvantageous if one is to engage in
constructing planar forms. As one forms these materials, one may again “read through” the
material to consider types of construction systems that might enable the shapes produced:
molded systems such as concrete or cast metals, stamped technologies such as those
utilized by automotive fabricators, or possibly even hand built up forms associated with
indigenous construction. However, it should be apparent that these types of systems will
typically involve other constraints, including cost of materials or labor, difficulty of producing
molds necessary for casting, and complexities in describing these shapes in a
mathematically rigorous, dimensionally controllable fashion.


Until relatively recently, geometric descriptions for such arbitrarily shaped forms did not exist.
The basic mathematics for describing the localized shape characteristics of smoothly curved
surfaces has existed in the theory of differential geometry since the 18th century12. However,
applications of this general theory were limited to the representation of specific, canonical
shapes, such as spheres, helices, tori, for which explicit, differentiable formulations could be
provided. In design applications, constructive approaches were required to render curved
geometries, through the use of French curves and ship splines. These techniques had limited
capabilities for representing forms to accurate tolerances.


Practical capabilities for the accurate representation of arbitrarily curved surfaces are directly
attributable to advances in computing. The curved descriptions that form the basis of
contemporary CAD systems were developed specifically for the purpose of digital
representation by Bézier, Coons, and others during the 1960s and 1970s74. The solution of
positional information from these shape description formulations require intensive
computational operations that are practical only through the use of computing.
Although these modeling techniques provide tremendous power and flexibility in representing
many curved surface geometries, they are still constrained by their mathematical definitions.
The base equations of Bézier and NURBS surfaces provide certain characteristics of
smoothing between the controlling geometry. These functions can be used to cast curved

                                                                                              105
surface representations over sampled spatial data. But in between this sampled data, the
surface formulations assume forms guided by their own functional characteristics. Tighter
conformance to digitized data from physical forms requires additional information, as well as
additional computational complexity of the surface description and associated user
interaction. At their limit, mathematical descriptions of curved surfaces can accommodate
any smooth surface form. But this limit condition is unachievable in practice. Increasing
levels of precision in the affinity between physical forms and their digital counterparts often
come with increasing costs in modeling and fabrication effort. The topological structuring of
NURBS surfaces –defined through sheet like elements (discussed further in Section V.D.3
below) do not map readily to the structuring of clay or other formed materials. While we can
imagine that designers working with rigid sheet materials intend to design constructions of
planar geometries, this logic does not extend to curved surface geometries. We can not
suppose that when designers work with clay they “really mean” to be manipulating NURBS
surfaces objects.


There exists a more important potential discrepancy between digital and physical renditions
of form. The digital constructs of curved surfaces do not in themselves exhibit any affinity
with the behaviors and characteristics of project materials. Unlike the tight conformance
between rigid sheet materials and planar geometries, there is typically little or no direct
correlation between operations on free form modeling materials and operations on NURBS
surface nets. The operations of physical modelers and those of their digital colleagues guide
these parties toward the generation of forms with perceptibly different qualities. The nuances
of physical forms - impacted by the behaviors of modeling materials during forming – can be
lost during translation to digital form, or require substantial operator skill and diligence to re-
impose on the digital model.


The impetus behind the early development of spline mathematics was in fact to approximate
the physically founded behavior of ship splines, thin metal strips used in the delineation of
ship hull forms, whose curvature characteristics were generated by material bending, and
loosely approximated the corresponding bending of wooden laths on the ship hull. In the
interim, however, the development of digital curved surface representation has diverged from
this material nature, to one more abstract, guided by the feasibility of operations on the
mathematical formulations themselves.


                                                                                               106
Truly free form shapes – constructed through
CNC driven molded or stamped fabrication
technologies – have had a relatively minor
role in Gehry’s work. The reasons for this
limited    role   are   largely    practical   and
economic. Currently, molding or stamping of
materials requires a unique, custom mold to
be developed for each surface element. The
labor and material required to develop the
mold can at the very least add a premium to             Figure IV-2: Horse’s head (DG Bank)

the cost of the system. This mold making
process can ultimately be vastly more
expensive than the typical costs of cladding
systems,     particularly   in    metal   stamping
process, where high strength materials must
be formed (Section II.C). Specific examples
exist, notably the conference room of the DG
Bank Headquarters project (Figure IV-2),             Figure IV-3 Horse’s head (Gagosian gallery)
formed from stamped plate steel. A second
version of this form was developed for the Gagosian gallery (Figure IV-3), this time through a
manual labor process of forming of sheet lead – highly malleable material.


This issue was elegantly addressed in the Neue Zollhof project in Dusseldorf (Figure IV-4),
where recyclable Styrofoam molds were developed as part of an innovative CNC based
process for forming cast concrete. The feasibility of this process resulted directly from
efficiencies found in the CNC mold forming process. The low strength of Styrofoam allowed it
to be routed at extremely high speed, reducing the machine time cost. Relatively low
tolerances and allowable roughness of the mold finish allowed the routing to be done with a
single pass of a large (approximately 2”) bit. The Styrofoam was recycled after the concrete
panel was formed, further reducing the material costs associated with the molding process.




                                                                                              107
                    Figure IV-4: CNC fabrication of cast concrete (Dusseldorf)


It is suggested that a second reason for the limited role of unconstrained, free form shapes in
Gehry’s designs: these shapes are simply “too easy”, and reflect the loss of correlation
between process and form in the qualities of the resulting shapes. This relatively open class
of shapes, supporting substantially unencumbered opportunities for form generation, lose the
“toughness” of form making as a consequence of this relatively open ended opportunity. It is
partly for this reason, in addition to the economic realities of constructibility, that even forms
initially modeled through the use of built up materials are eventually rationalized into
compositions of more highly constrained materials.


                                                                                              108
Gehry has shown an ongoing interest in the use of fabric or mesh materials, beginning with
early works including the Gehry Residence, Edgemar Development, and Santa Monica
Place. As with other forms and materials, these materials have remained part of his
vocabulary, even as they have been pushed to more extreme forms on recent designs.
These materials in unrationalized form have been successfully realized on several sculptural
projects, including the Barcelona Fish and Guggenheim retrospective installations (2001,
discussed in Section VII.J below). To date the use these materials have not been achieved
on building projects, in part due to the lack of available materials satisfying performance and
life safety criteria. For example, fiberglass was initially considered as a building material for
the Lewis Residence (unbuilt, 1989-95), but was rejected in part because no products could
be found that satisfied fire safety requirements. The class of shapes represented by the
forming of fabric presents what at first glance appears to be a quite open, unconstrained
vocabulary of potential forms. However, again, on closer inspection, we can see behavior of
these materials guiding generated forms in subtle but important ways. Features such as folds
and creases generated by the subtle rigidity of the material are discernable in the shapes
produced. The geometric definition of this behavior is not easily captured by contemporary
NURBS modeling. Mesh materials are closely related to other sheet based materials that will
be described in depth below.

Somewhere between the highly constrained class of planar geometries and the general class
of curved surface forms lies the broad class of paper-like shapes that are the central focus of
this inquiry. We may loosely describe this class of paper surfaces to be those constructed by
smoothly bending flat, flexible sheet materials in space, and assembling these surfaces into
closed shapes at their boundaries. In this thesis, this class of geometries will be referred to
synonymously as either paper surfaces or sheet material surfaces, with the assumption that
certain constraints on the method of forming these sheet materials are observed. In Gehry’s
current work, paper surfaces represent perhaps the most prevalent and important class of
surface forms, encompassing a constellation of formal intentions, materials, fabrication
economies and methods, physical and digital representations, and rationalizing operations.
The importance of this class of surfaces in Gehry’s current work, and complexities in the
development of corresponding, sufficiently facile digital representations, are the impetus for

                                                                                           110
the research described in the remainder of this thesis. A qualitative description of their role in
Gehry’s design and building processes will serve as an introduction to the formal description
of their geometric representations in subsequent sections.


The forms assumed by paper and other sheet materials in scale physical models have
important counterparts in full scale construction. Many materials of construction have
analogous constraints that at least qualitatively constrain full scale fabricated building
elements to assume sheet like forms (Figure IV-7). These materials may be readily formed
by manual methods into curved shapes in space, so long as these forms do not require
stretch forming of the material that would produce plastic deformation in the plane of the
surface material. This relationship between the material constraints of modeling materials in
scale and the constraints of fabrication may only be approximate. However, for schematic
design purposes, this approximate correspondence may be sufficient to guarantee the
constructibility of designed forms.


Paper surface shapes are obviously less constrained than the class of planar Euclidean
shapes, and may be viewed as a super-set of these forms. This is easily, albeit qualitatively,
demonstrated by positioning a sheet of paper flat on a table, then lifting up one of its corners.
The paper surface class encompasses the flat configuration and the final configuration of the
sheet, as well as of the intermediate states between.


At the same time, the class is clearly quite constrained. While there is a broad class of
shapes that may be constructed from a single sheet of paper positioned in space, there is
certainly a much larger set of shapes (spheres, airplanes, Walt Disney characters, etc.) that
can not be tightly covered by a paper sheet. Attempting to force the sheet tightly onto these
shapes will be only partly successful, as wrinkling, creasing or ripping of the sheet will occur.


Unlike planar geometries, where the shapes formed by rigid materials are independent of the
actual materials of construction, shapes formed from flexible sheet materials are highly
conditioned by the material. Paper, rubber sheet, plate steel, plaster board, aluminum foil, all
of these materials impose significantly different constraints on their corresponding set of
constructible shapes. Some will break before they achieve the shapes enabled by others,
some will assume shapes with a more less continuous or smooth form. Of course, if such
features as creases, wrinkles and rips are desired, a potentially larger class of shapes is

                                                                                              111
enabled. Similarly, one may construct increasingly complex shapes by attaching sheets
together, perhaps while allowing gaps, overlaps or creases between the sheets, introducing
interior cuts or “dodges” at the edges of sheets, etc. Changing the boundary shape of a sheet
of paper will radically affect its corresponding set of possible shapes. Generally, assemblies
of a large number of smaller sheets allow more highly curved shapes those that can be
formed by a few larger sheets.


In light of this expanding list of qualitative characteristics, the development of simple
geometric representations that captures these qualities appears to be a difficult proposition.
Geometric formulations representative of this class are likely to be much more difficult to
establish than those governing Euclidean planar shapes. At the same time, these surfaces
are highly constrained relative to the free form surfaces. It can be postulated that the
definition of paper surface geometries could be formulated as a constraint condition imposed
on the description of freely formed surfaces, and thus represent a sub-class of this more
general class of surface descriptions.


The role of the material itself in guiding operations of designers constructing physical paper
forms cannot be overstated. The designers respond to the behavior of these materials as
they work with them in a direct, tactile fashion. Through this interactive process, designers
are naturally guided toward feasible configurations of the materials. The designs produced
through this active, physical process naturally obey the constraints of material behavior. The
physicality of this direct tactile interaction shields the designer from the vast world of possible
configurations just outside the surface class.


A surprisingly large set of building systems are governed by constraints of flexible sheet
materials (Figure III-17). The most obvious such systems are those actually clad with sheet
materials such as sheet metal or plywood (Figure III-17A).           However, even within this
typology there is a considerable range of materials, aesthetic and fabrication requirements,
the qualities of which will have implications on the set of admissible surface forms. Examples
range from overlapping shingled systems to continuous welded metal back pan systems. The
materials, geometry of inter-panel seams, and perhaps most importantly the size and
organization of sheets comprising the system all affect the qualities of feasible surfaces that
may be constructed.

Beyond purely cladded systems, numerous other construction systems may require shapes
exhibiting paper surface geometries. Although concrete is a molded material, the form work
which generates the shape of poured concrete shapes is often built from plywood, which in
turn can assume a paper shape (Figure III-17B). Glass can be slumped into curved surface
formwork, but there are limitations on the in plane deformation that can be accommodated
without residual stress in the glass when cooled (Figure III-17C). Paper surface forms have
been shown to provide a reasonable predictor of these constraints.


With this wide variety of construction materials, methods and assemblies to be considered,
the utility of scale paper sheet materials to accurately represent the allowable forms is
somewhat questionable. However, for many types of construction, paper modeling materials
have been shown to at least qualitatively represent the forms that may be constructed, and in
fact establish more conservative constraints than those permissible by the full scale
fabrication.



                                                                                                 113
In the following development of digital modeling representations for sheet surface fabrication
constraints, it will be useful to keep in mind some of the qualitative features that characterize
these systems and contribute to these constraints.


The overall, global shape of the surface assembly is the point of departure for considering
qualities contributing to the form’s constructibility. It is here that the initial physical modeling
and materials used in this process contribute to an understanding of the shape’s
constructibility. Individual sheets employed on physical models vary in character and size,
from full height wall size sheets to smaller panels perhaps 10’ in scale. Critical issues such
as the shape of boundaries of these macro scale sheets and the ways in which they are
attached together have enormous implications on the types of forms that may be feasibly
generated.


Localized smoothness of form is an inherent characteristic of the paper shape class. Again,
while “catastrophic” operations- such as crumpling, ripping or stretching by stamping - can
be undertaken, these operations and the forms that are generated represent extensions or
violations of the rules of construction and corresponding definition of the class. Sheet
materials respond to externally applied forces and actions by assuming smooth variation
between these externally applied constraints. However, sheet materials have limits on the
magnitude of deformation they can respond to. Beyond those limits, the material will either
refuse to go, perhaps popping fasteners intended to hold the material into shape, perhaps
buckling or tearing. The intentional introduction of discontinuities into a smoothly continuous
surface can alleviate the materials’ resistance to being positioned in a given way. If the
design intent for the form allows discontinuities in the material’s shape, then considerably
more flexibility in the global nature of the shape is possible.


As a trivial example, spheres of any size can be constructed by tessellating the surface into
triangles, resulting in a geodesic dome31,32. The panels of the dome do not necessarily have
to be flat, but rather could assume some limited degree of curvature. The remainder of the
sphere’s curvature would continue to be made up at the panel seams. In this simple
example, the tradeoffs between surface curvature, tangency discontinuities and fitness to the
“design” surface are readily apparent (Figure IV-8).




                                                                                               114
The introduction of discontinuities in the
smoothed form of global scale paper
surface gestures is a key activity of
rationalization activities on global shapes.
The design intent will introduce a system of
constraints     on   the   nature   of   these
rationalization operations, where they may
occur, the layout and pattern of these
discontinuities and the degree to which
these discontinuities may appear in the
surface form.


The issues encountered at the macro scale
of the project form play out at a variety of
scales. Cladded systems are ultimately
constructed from individual facing sheets of
material. Similar considerations regarding
the shapes of these panels and their
assembly with one another occur at this
level. In a sense, it is at this level that the
ultimate determination of whether or not a
surface is constructible occurs. The macro
scale form of a wall or roof shape is
                                                     Figure IV-8: Rationalization of a sphere
propagated down to this face sheet level.
However, modification of face sheet sizes, shapes and organizations can have dramatic
implications on the types of shapes that are possible. Economic considerations in fabrication
processes may limit the sheet sizes and edge conditions. Specific materials will be limited to
certain maximum sheet sizes. Break forming of panels – a relatively inexpensive forming
process - will limit edges to straight cuts, as opposed to the extended possibilities for sheet
boundaries available using CNC cutting techniques.




                                                                                                115
Many cladding systems are built up of more
than one layer of material (Figure IV-9). For
example, a typical cladding strategy may
adopt a back pan serving as the substrate for
the actual waterproofing layer, while a rain
screen or shingle system is positioned outside
of this layer as the actual finish surface. Either
of these systems may present the more highly
constrained layer of the assembly. Frequently
it is the waterproofing layer that presents the
more rigid requirements in terms of continuity,
material      sheets   and    sizes,    fastening
strategies,     etc.   Alternatively,   aesthetic
requirements of the finish surface such as
smoothness of appearance may govern.

                                                     Figure IV-9: Macro and element scale sheet
The presence of seams between individual                           forms (Bilbao)
assembly sheets contributes substantially to differences in behavior between macro level
shape studies and the shapes feasibly constructed out of panelized systems. Panels
naturally introduce opportunities for introducing overlaps between individual sheets, slight or
substantial discontinuities in the smoothness of the overall shape, and the possibility of slight
warping of the material sheets. These effects are not identifiable at the macro level. This
potential relaxation of constraint conditions as design heads toward actual fabrication is of
course beneficial to the design process, and provides in essence a factor of safety in the
schematic design of the project forms.


A rigorous understanding of the implications of panel system edge conditions is difficult to
achieve, since subtle features of the physical geometry of panel-to-panel joints can have
substantial effects on the geometry of the ensuing form. For example, the force of
attachment of individual fasteners such as screws, which fix surface panels to supports, can
affect the degree of shape discontinuity at panel edges.


Material qualities play a significant role in the qualities of surfaces that will be formed when
deforming sheets of these materials into paper surface shapes. These qualities include the

                                                                                             116
actual material properties such as stiffness and brittleness. Material thickness and forming
activities will affect the behavior of these materials. Thick plywood sheets will behave
differently under deformation than layered assemblies of thin plywood sheets with the same
thickness. Where titanium panels have been used, these sheets have typically been used
with a thinner gauge than stainless steel or aluminum panels. Titanium is resistant to ductile
deformation, and will thus typically be resistant to being forced into shapes with any in plane
deformation. In contrast, lead and pewter sheet materials are highly ductile, and will readily
assume shapes that would require molding or stamping of more conventional surfacing
materials. Stainless steel has been used on different projects with a wide variety of gauges,
from thin sheet to plate steel, with large differences in the limitations on shapes that can be
produced.


Strategies for the organization of system components will have many implications on the
surface qualities of paper surfaces. Similarly, the design intent in terms of the desired surface
qualities will guide the selection of surface fabrication strategies. Surface fabrication systems
will introduce a host of constraints presenting rules for the organization of surface
components. Patterning strategies for sheet layouts will obviously be affected by the
organization of sub-framing systems. Systems using straight members organized in an
undulating form have been successfully applied to the construction of paper surface forms
(Chapter V.B.). The economics of specific fabrication strategies that generate the constraints
of paper surface forms will likely include specific additional implications for the way in which
the systems components are organized, and the types of shapes that may be economically
constructed using a given fabrication system. It is also possible for several different systems
to be employed on different regions of a project, depending on the complexity of the localized
surface form. For example, less curved surface areas may afford more straight forward
construction, while more highly curved areas of are addressed with a more forgiving, less
economical fabrication approach.


The formidable role of paper surface systems in Gehry’s work and the complexity of these
systems’ formal constraints have placed a substantial demand on CAD modeling efforts. The
geometric controls and operations by which paper surfaces are constructed in digital form
are radically different than - and in many ways impoverished compared to - the flexibility and
intuitiveness of direct material manipulation. For this reason, the process of faithfully re-
constructing the physically generated forms in a digital context has been a time and labor-

                                                                                             117
intensive process. More troubling is that these surface modeling techniques may introduce
constraints on the digital surface forms that are different than those of physical modeling
materials or their fabricated counterparts.


This dichotomy between physical objects and their analytical counterparts is not new. In
traditional engineering, limitations of analytical approaches to perfectly represent real world
conditions are addressed implicitly by introducing factors of safety: backing away from the
true limits of the materials and engineering in a more conservative manner than might be
possible. Changes in analytical methods have at times allowed less conservative approaches
to similar systems, such as the introduction of plastic deformation considerations into steel
frame design in the 1980s.


These issues play out in the engineering and construction of paper surface forms as well.
Many of the techniques for modeling paper surface systems include notions of factors of
safety, constraining the surface form somewhat in order to be able to guarantee
constructibility. Other approaches rely on rationalizing paper surface forms into canonical
shapes such as cylinders and planes whose constructibility may by nature be guaranteed.
Both of these approaches present obvious drawbacks, in that the qualities of shapes
generated by rationalizing may be qualitatively different than the ideal surfaces, and may
also not truly represent the limits of what can be fabricated. This discrepancy between the
initial physically modeled forms, those that can possibly be fabricated, and the rationalized
forms representing the limits of our predictive capabilities may not be completely resolvable.
Nonetheless, an ongoing goal of computational research by the firm is to achieve greater
parity between these three worlds as materials are pushed further toward their limits.


In the context of Gehry’s digital building delivery process, the limits imposed by digital
representation present an ultimate constraint on the inclusion of forms in the design
vocabulary. If forms can not be described in the project documentation in a manner through
which their constructibility can be substantiated, then they can not feasibly be
accommodated in construction, regardless of the actual abilities of craftsmen to perform the
work. This limiting condition creates urgency for developing representations of sheet
materials, which accurately reflect fabrication constraints without imposing additional
constraints resulting purely from limitations of the geometric representation itself.

V. Mathematics of Curved Spaces and Objects
The remainder of this thesis will develop descriptions of paper surfaces through geometric
and mathematical formalisms. This chapter reviews the essential formalisms of non-
Euclidean geometric constructs that are at the heart of virtually all curved object
representations found in contemporary CAD applications. The development of paper surface
representations will be developed within this general formalism. The discussion in this
chapter follows the derivations in classical texts on differential and non-Euclidean geometry
such as Kresig47, Bonola12, and O’Neil60, and discussions of manifolds provided Bishop and
Goldberg7.

A.        SPACES IN MATHEMATICAL FORMS
Readers familiar with the basic operations of
CAD systems will have an understanding of
the conventional representations of primitive
objects,    as    being       defined   in   terms    of
coordinates. The notion of a point, residing in
3D space, as being defined by an ordered set
of number p = (x,y,z) should be readily
apparent. The description of more complex
objects    in    terms    of    basic   functions     on
                                                                                 A
coordinates should also be readily apparent.
We may describe a line segment in terms of
an ordered pair of points, (p,q), which are may
in turn be described by their coordinates as
above. It should be recognized that this basic
description is not the totality of the behavior of
a line segment in space, rather, the end point
coordinates form the basis for a function,
which describes a set of points on the interior
of the line segment (Figure V-1A). The end                                       B

points     of    the   line    segment       form    one   Figure V-1: A line as a function on end points

representation of these conditions; there are
alternative descriptions of the conditioning of points on the line segment as well. For example
(Figure V-1B), we may equivalently describe this same line segment through a starting point
                                                                                                      119
(p), a vector describing a direction in space (q - p), and a range of distances along this
vector from the initial point which represent the range of the line segment (0 ≤ t ≤ | q – p|).


These examples rely on a common, unifying coordinate representation of 3-space, where a
point in the space may be uniquely described by its ordered triple of coordinates. Two points
in this space are equivalent if and only if their coordinates are equivalent:


p = q iff (xp = xq, yp = yq, zp = zq)


While this representation of space suffices for basic Euclidean primitives, such as points,
lines, and planes, this representation of a space and the elements that reside in it becomes
problematic for more complicated spatial elements. For example, a curve in space may be
construed as being comprised of a set of points in space similar to that of a line. However,
the description of the curve through an analogous function on its interior points will be more
difficult.


Additionally, it is often useful to consider objects from the perspective of other spatial
constructs than a homogenous 3-space representation. For example, architectural drawings
typically consider the objects of their inquiry in terms of two dimensional representations
such as plans and sections. These representations are inherently two dimensional, and may
be read as such. The observer of these configurations may vary her frame of reference on
these objects, alternating between considering the represented objects as two dimensional
objects in the space of the drawing, as well as “reading through” to the three dimensional
counterparts represented by these artifacts. A rigorous, formal description of spatial
representations which allows translation between these interpretations is of benefit, rather
than considering the two dimensional form of the drawing as some sort of emaciated
abstraction relative to the “true” nature of the objects in some preferred, integrative 3-D
space.


To circumvent the limitations of descriptive capabilities of a common 3-D descriptive space,
we will need to turn to more general representations of spaces, which allow multiple spatial
representations to co-exist. Such a system should support the development of spatial
organizations as independent constructs – allowing the objects within a given spatial
representation to be considered, while additionally allowing opportunities for associations

                                                                                                  120
between spatial organizations to be supported. Such a structure will allow individual objects
such as curves and surfaces to be considered from a spatial perspective that highlights the
invariant qualities of the object, while in turn allowing its consideration relative to other
objects that may in turn have spatial structuring in their own terms.


To expand on this notion of mathematical spaces, we must initially disregard some of the
innate notions of physical space, and rather consider spaces whose character is simply
based on permutations of numerical values. A space, in mathematical terms, is simply an
ordered set of variables, e.g. (x1, x2, . . . , xn ). A point in this space is equivalent to a specific
instantiation of values for these variables, such as (x1= c1, x2= c2, . . . , xn= cn). The specific
values as (c1, c2, . . . , cn) are termed the coordinates of the point. A space with this structure
is termed a Cartesian product space of n real variables or Rn.


Such mathematical spaces, developed simply as a description of ordered sets of variables,
may be naturally combined into higher order constructs. Our definition of a line as defined by
two points may be constructed as an ordered set of two R3 Cartesian product spaces – one
for each set of the possible coordinates of each end point. The set of all possible line
segments is defined in the (R3 × R3) space, instantiated by the specification of six
parameters: (x1p= c1, x2p= c2, x3p= c3, x1q= c4, x2q= c5, x3q= c6).


Cartesian product spaces provide much of the structuring required for the description of
geometric objects. However, geometric spatial constructs often require the definition of an
additional metric on the relationship between locations defined in the space. In and of
themselves, Cartesian product spaces do not establish any notion of proximity or nearness
between elements defined in the space. While it seems obvious that the point (0,0,0) is
nearer to the point (1,0,0) than it is to the point (10,0,0), this is not a property of the simplistic
notion of ordered sets of numbers. The establishment of a metric or distance function on
members of a Cartesian product space allows notions of nearness, neighborhoods and
continuity of spatial elements between coordinates in space to be defined. A metric function
is a (symmetric, positive, nondegenerative) function of the form
δ : Rn × Rn → R                                                                                  (V.1)


that takes two locations (equivalently, points) in the space and returns a real valued distance
between them. One obvious such metric function is the Euclidean distance function:
                                                                                                  121
             ( q1 − p1 )       + ( q2 − p2 ) + ( q3 − p3 )
                           2                 2               2
δ (p, q) =                                                                                                       (V.2)


The specification of this Euclidean distance function on a Cartesian product n-space provides
the structuring of the familiar Euclidean descriptions of elemental elements such as lines and
points. Since this function is true also of simple permutations of real numbers, Euclidean
space and Cartesian product n-spaces of independent or orthogonal variables are often used
interchangeably. In the following discussion, we will encounter spaces representing
parameters on objects for which this simple metric function no longer holds.



B.        VECTOR SPACES
Spaces of numbers are expanded by considering spaces of vectors. The notion of a vector
may be considered initially to be a primitive object, characterizing the spatial concept of
directedness in space. For each variable, (x1, x2, . . . , xn ), we may assign a vector in space,
and assign the corresponding coordinate as representing a multiple of this vector. A set of n
linearly independent vectors serve as a basis for the space; by linearly independence we can
simply state that no vector of the set may be expressed as a combination of any others of the
set. In R3 this simply means that the 3 basis vectors may not be co-planar.


Euclidean spaces may be characterized as
vector spaces, where an obvious set of basis
vectors      exists:           the    unit       vectors         eˆ i ,
representing a unit length in each of the
directions of the axes. It is important to keep
this dual nature of Euclidean n space firmly in
mind, as an ordered set of n scalar values,
and as a vector space characterized by the
unit vectors eˆ i . In Euclidean spaces, the basis

vectors eˆ i are orthogonal and invariant, in that
their magnitude and direction remain constant
over the space. The notion of a point in space                            Figure V-2: Euclidean space basis vectors

is equivalent to that of a vector in space, since


                                                                                                                  122
we can describe the point p = (x1, x2, x3) as a vector from the origin, defined as the sum of i
vectors of length xi in the direction of eˆ i :


p = ∑ xi eˆ i                                                                                   (V.3)


In representing curved objects, we must draw
on spatial constructs whose characteristics are
substantially more complicated than those of
Euclidean spaces. By way of departure, we
may consider affine vector spaces (Figure
V-3), characterized by n basis vectors, whose
directions are not necessarily orthogonal, and
whose magnitude is not necessarily unit.
Euclidean space may be considered to be a
special case of affine space.

1.       Vector Fields                               Figure V-3: Description of a point in an affine
The notion of a vector field may now be                             vector space

introduced. Consider the application of a
tangent vector vp at a point p in Rn space: the tail of the vector begins at the point p, while
the direction of the vector is described by n ordered coordinates, indicating the direction and
distance described by the vector. A tangent vector vp is thus described by two ordered sets
of n variables: the point of application p, and the vector part v.


The set of possible vectors with application at p thus may be characterized as a Euclidean
space in its own right. We may consider each such vector to be equivalent or dual to a point
in this vector space, associated with the point of application p. By extension, we may
consider the combination of all points and all tangent vectors to these points in Rn to be
Cartesian product space of character Rn × Rn = R2n , a six dimensional Cartesian product
space for tangent vectors in R3. Often, however, in considering deformations of spatial
objects, we will be concerned with multiple vectors emanating from a single point of
consideration. We may thus consider these vectors from the perspective of a coordinate
system with its origin at the common application point of the vectors p. In doing so, we


                                                                                                 123
diverge from the simple framework of a single coordinate system defined over the entire
space.


A vector field is a function F: p → v(p)| p ∈ M, that assigns a tangent vector to each point p
of some region M of Rn. Specifying a region M allows the construct of a general vector field
to be applied only to domains of Rn of interest to a given application, such as curves or
surfaces, where the vector field may be undefined for regions of space outside of the
domain.

2.       Coordinate Fields
With the construct of vector fields in place, the basis is established for defining non-rectilinear
coordinate systems in Rn. Vector fields may be combined to construct general coordinate
systems on Rn, by establishing an n –part function:


φ i : p → vi (p) | i ∈ (1. . . n ), p ∈ M                                                       (V.4)


The vectors vi form a basis of M provided that
vi are linearly independent for each point p
in M.    Thus    any     vector    whose    point    of
application     is   p   may      be   resolved     into
components in terms of the basis vectors vi.
We will limit ourselves to consideration of
vector basis functions that are differentiable
over     M,   allowing    assumptions       such     as
                                                             Figure V-4: a vector field in R3
continuity and smoothness to be assumed.


The notion of a coordinate system varying at every point of application may cause some
initial concern, since it seems incongruous with initial notions derived from the usual
conventions of coordinate systems on Euclidean n space. For example, we can not directly
determine the coordinates of a point p2 from the coordinate field at p1 by mapping the vector
p2 – p1 onto the basis vectors at p1, the way one could in the natural coordinate system.
However, again, in considering curved objects in space, we will principally be concerned with
the local character of the object, “near” a point under consideration. The localized coordinate
field will provide a structure for considering this localized character of the object.

                                                                                                 124
3.         Frame Fields
The previous section established the notion of a coordinate system defined by basis vectors,
continuously varying over a region of space. This coordinate system was established in
terms of a set of n linearly independent basis vectors, whose direction and magnitude was
dependent on the given point in space. While this construct provides broad generality for
coordinate systems, this generality comes at some computational complexity. Even a simple
operation as resolving a vector into its components in a general basis requires solution of a
set of inter-dependent, linear equations.


With one important constraint on the basis vectors,
the complexity of the coordinate system can be
dramatically reduced. A frame field is a set of
mutually orthogonal, unit length vectors eˆ i , applied
to every point in a region of Rn. Since these vectors
are orthogonal and unit length, the dot product
between any pair of these vectors, eˆ i • ê j , is 0

unless i=j, in which case the dot product is equal to
1. We may introduce the important short hand
notation of the Kroneker delta δ:


eˆ i • eˆ j = δij                                             (V.5)
                                                                         Figure V-5: Expansion of a vector by
                                                                              orthonormal basis vectors.
where:
δij = 0        if i ≠ j,
      1        if i = j,

The components of a vector v in the coordinate system defined by basis vectors eˆ i are
simply the dot product of the vector with the corresponding basis vector: The coordinate of v
in the terms of the basis vector eˆ i is simply the real value:


ci = v • eˆ i                                                                                              (V.6)

                           th
Therefore, the i                component of v is the vector ci eˆ i the basis vector eˆ i scaled by length ci. v
is then the sum of these n components:

                                                                                                            125
v = ∑ ( v • eˆ i )eˆ i                                                                                (V.7)


The process of resolving a vector into its components in terms of the frame vectors is termed
orthonormal expansion.


Having previously established the notion of a general coordinate field in Section 6, the frame
field represents a “step backward” to a less general construct. Note that the “natural”
coordinate system (x,y,z), is a special, additionally constrained frame field whose basis
vectors are invariant over the space. Frame fields enjoy some of the simplicity of Euclidean
space, but only at local points of application. In investigating the shape of curved spatial
objects, we will be establishing appropriate frame fields on these objects that highlight their
localized characteristics.



C.       MAPPINGS
We will next consider mappings between spatial representations - the means by which
disparate spaces and objects expressed in these spaces may be integrated. A mapping may
be defined between pairs of spatial representations. A mapping from a space N = (x1, x2,. . . ,
xn), to a space M = (y1, y2,. . . , ym) is a set of m functions, that expresses the relationships
between the coordinates of the two spaces:


(y1, y2,. . . , ym) = (φ1(x1, x2,. . . , xn), φ2(x1, x2,. . . , xn) ,. . . , φm(x1, x2,. . . , xn))


We may consider this mapping both in terms of the individual coordinate mapping functions:
φi ∈ (φ1. . . φm),

or simplify our notation in considering the set of functions to be a single multi-part function, of
the form:


φ: N → M         (read: φ maps N to M )




                                                                                                       126
Similarly, we should expect that if such a mapping function exists, then an inverse function
exists, mapping from the space M back into the space N, of the form:


φ -1 : M → N                                               (read: the inverse of φ maps M to N )


For the purposes of exploring curved spatial objects, we will presume that these mapping
functions are differentiable to the degree appropriate for the required application, i.e. that
rates of change in the coordinate variables of the space M can be determined by considering
the rates of change in the variables of the space N. A mapping function is infinitely
differentiable if each of the coordinate mapping functions φi possesses valid derivates up to
infinite order. Typically we will be interested in mappings that present derivatives at least up
to some finite order.


In considering the forms of curved spatial objects, the structure presented by these
differentials will often have greater significance than the actual mapping functions
themselves. While we may of course be interested in the actual placement of objects in
space, the geometric nature of these objects are frequently invariant, should the object be
subject to some translation in the space. In such an event, the localized rates of change of
the mapping function between the parametric and embedding space will be preserved, while
the specific functions mapping coordinates between these spatial representations may not.
We will from time to time consider the structure of curved spatial objects in terms of these
derivative functions, without explicitly stating the characteristics of the mapping functions
themselves.


Mapping between frame fields is a straight forward computation. Given a vector v with
components vi = ci eˆ i , we wish to determine its components vj = dj fˆj in some second

coordinate system, whose basis are the orthogonal, unit length vectors fˆj .                 The

transformation is found by resolving each basis vector eˆ i into its components in the frame fˆj .

These components are found by conducting an orthonormal expansion of each vector eˆ i :


aij = eˆ i • fˆj                                                                            (V.8)



                                                                                              127
The jth component of v in the coordinate frame fˆj can then be found by summing the

contribution of each of its components in the directions eˆ i , as they are resolved into the

direction of fˆj :



d j = ∑ aij ci                                                                                  (V.9)

v i = ∑ (aij ci )fˆj
       i




1.         Manifolds
The above discussion has used the term
space in a fairly unformulated manner. We
have seen the term applied to ordered sets of
numbers, and alternatively have discussed the
concept of vectors spaces. The concept of a
manifold      allows   a   rigorous   definition   of
geometric objects and their occupancy in
space through mappings between a local
coordinate system, intrinsically defined on
spatial object and Euclidean in nature, and
some extrinsic, containing space. We will refer
loosely to the intrinsic space of the object as
the parametric or embedded space of the
object, and the space into which this object is
mapped as the containing or embedding
space. The topological characteristics of the           Figure V-6: A manifold, defined as a mapping
object are determined by the orders of each of           between parametric and containing spaces

these spaces. In turn, the shape of the object
in the containing space is largely determined by the mapping function.


A manifold is properly defined as a topological space in which some neighborhood of each
point admits a coordinate system. The passage between coordinate systems at neighboring
points is smoothly continuous, allowing notions of differentiability of the space and bodies

                                                                                                 128
described in the space. If X is a topological space, a chart at p ∈ X is a function µ : U → Rd,
where U is an open set containing p. The concept of a manifold allows notions of elements of
a space to be constructed independently of an particular coordinate system, and provides the
basis for establishing mapping between coordinate systems. Additional structuring
appropriate for modeling of physical systems, such as distance and other spatial metrics may
be overlaid on the structure of manifolds, whereas notions of continuity, smoothness, and
differentiability are part of the structure of manifolds themselves.

2.     Submanifolds and Imbeddings
With the structure of vector spaces and mapping functions between these spaces in place,
we have the formal basis necessary to discuss the means by which spaces – and the objects
defined in these spaces – can be integrated.


In contrast to the “conventional” spatial structure of simple CAD systems, where the
structuring of objects occurs through a single, principal, 3-D Euclidean space, we instead
consider a notion of space constructed from multiple manifolds of differing dimension, with
equal weight in the total description of spatial objects, integrated by mapping functions
between these objects. Given a manifold N of dimension n, we will consider the means by
which other spatial constructs may be embedded within this space.


A manifold M is imbedded in N if there is a invertible, differentiable map Φ: M → N, which
supports a invertible coordinate function for every point Φ(m) in N. A proper imbedding of M
into N requires that the image of M in the space of N not self intersect, since this would
prohibit the unambiguous mapping backward of certain points in N. This limitation can be
addressed by considering the imbedding to be valid on regions of M that are not mapped to
points of overlap in the image.


This section has presented some of the mathematical foundations necessary for describing
curved objects in space. In particular, we have moved away from space as being defined by
a global coordinate system, and objects in this space as being merely functions on points in
this space. Instead, both space and spatial objects are resolved through the concept of
manifolds. Manifolds are not simply coordinate functions, but rather objects and sets of
objects, spatial, numerical or other. Their structure and relationships are determined by the
ability to map these objects to others, through mapping functions on their ranges, and their

                                                                                           129
variation in these ranges. The imbedding of objects in spaces, or spaces into other spaces, is
achieved strictly through notions of imbedding.


The subsequent sections will describe general applications of these principals to two
important classes of deformable objects: curves and surfaces.



D.        CURVES AND SURFACES

1.        Curves in R3
In contrast with the above sections, we will focus on the special cases of objects in 3D
space, and replace the above inquiry of an n dimensional space with the special case of R3.


A curve is a mapping from an interval I in the
(one dimensional) real line R, to its image in
R3. A manifold description of a curve in R3 is a
function which maps a single parameter on an
interval I of the real number line to locations in
3-space, of the form:


α (t ) = (α1(t ), α 2 (t ), α 3 (t ) ) | t ∈ I                                                 (V.10)


                                                       Figure V-7: A space curve as three mapping
where α1(t), α2(t), and α3(t) are some as yet                           functions
unspecified functions which produce a value for the corresponding coordinate, given a value
for t. The functions are valid on some interval I for t such that t1 ≤ t ≤ t2, where t1 and t2 specify
the limits of the interval. This curve function may be succinctly stated as:


α: I → R3                                                                                     (V.11)


We assume that the functions αi(t) are differentiable. The nature of α as a function and as a
curve in space is indistinguishable from a mathematical perspective.


The parameter t is sometimes considered analogous to time; one can imagine the function
α sweeping a curve in space as it maps points to t, while t, a parameter independent of the
                                                                                                 130
space R3, structures this sweeping through space. In keeping with this temporal analogy, we
may consider the first derivative of the function α at a particular value of t to be the velocity
vector of α at t, of the form:


          ∂α1       ∂α 2       ∂α 3 
α ′(t ) =     (t ),      (t ),     (t )                                                (V.12)
          ∂t         ∂t         ∂t      α ( t )


This function determines the instantaneous direction of travel of the curve at a specific point
in space, in much the same way that the velocity of an object passing through space
indicates the instantaneous direction of the object’s travel. Geometrically, this derivative with
respect to t is the tangent of the curve α. The vector α ’(t) also has a length or magnitude.
This magnitude is derived from the parameterization of the function α, and is not discernable
from the geometric shape of the curve itself. As this discussion of curved objects progresses,
the distinction will be explored between the parametric, functionally derived qualities of a
curve on one hand, and the purely spatial properties of the curve on the other.


By way of progression to discussing these purely geometric properties of curves, we
consider the fact that the specific parameterization of the function α does not uniquely
describe the curve in space; rather, there are a potentially unlimited number of
parameterizations which can describe the same path through space. Drawing on the
temporal analogy, a given path in space may be traversed by any number of speeds, and
variations of speed along the path. This reparametrization of the curve α may be constructed
as follows:


Let α: I → R3 be a curve. Let η: J → I be a differentiable function on an open interval J of R.
The function:


β = α (η (s ))                                                                            (V.13)


is a reparametrization of α by η. The function η imbeds the interval J into I, and is of the form
R → R. The velocity vector β’ is related to α’ through the chain rule:




                                                                                             131
            dη (s )
β '(s ) =           α '(η (s ))                                                           (V.14)
             ds


Since α’η(s) is simply the tangent vector of α at the reparameterized location η(s), and
dη(s)/ ds is the derivative of a scalar, the tangent vector of the two parameterizations differ
only by magnitude. This maps to real world experience, where the same path taken with
differing velocities differ in their instantaneous velocities at a location in speed, but not
direction.


The second derivative of α with respect to the parameter t is - in our temporal analogue – the
acceleration of the curve, and takes the form:


       d 2α1 d 2α 2 d 2α 3 
α ′′ =    2
             , 2 , 2                                                                     (V.15)
       dt     dt     dt α


In contrast with velocity, the acceleration vector is not generally tangent to the curve except
for the trivial case of a straight line. Additionally, unlike the tangent vector, whose direction
was independent of the particular parameterization, the acceleration vector’s direction will
depend on the parameterization chosen. This, again, maps to temporal experience. A vehicle
traveling at constant velocity around a circle will experience centripetal acceleration toward
the center of the circle. If, however, the vehicle is simultaneously accelerating, the
acceleration felt by the passengers will be the composite of both the centripetal acceleration
and that in the tangential direction. Thus the direction of the acceleration experienced will be
dependent on the velocity function. It is apparent that the specific choice of a parametric
space and mapping function has a large implication on our “experience” of the curve from the
perspective of the parametric space. At the same time, different parameterizations and
mappings can produce the same curve in space. One might ask if there is an improved
representation of the curve that illuminates its shape properties, independent of the chosen
parameterization. To achieve this, an important, canonical coordinization of the space curve
will be developed in terms of a frame field that is defined by the shape of the curve itself. We
postulate a reparametrization of the curve β(s) such that the magnitude of the velocity vector
at each point is 1:


β : I → R 3 | β ′(s ) = 1 for all s ∈ I                                                   (V.16)
                                                                                             132
In principle, any curve can be reparameterized
as a unit speed curve. We can establish this
reparameterization               for          any   curve   initially
defined by some arbitrary parameter t. We first
define the arc length, or distance along the
curve as:


           t                              t
s (t ) =   ∫
           t0

                                          t0
                                               α& • α& dt                                                                   (V.17)



i.e., the integral of the change of position in
the original curve function. We will adopt the
                                                                          Figure V-8: Mapping of a curve to a unit arc

curve function with respect to some general parameter t, will be denoted t& , and derivatives
with respect to the arc length s by s’. We may map between these derivatives as follows:


      ds
s& =      =      α& α& = α&
      dt
      ds&       α& α&&

         ds



We call t =β ’ the unit tangent vector field on β .
                                                                            Figure V-9: Osculating plane of a curve
All vectors normal to t at β (s) lie in a place
called the normal plane to the curve β at s *.




*
    Note that the vector t is not in any way directly related to the parameter t; the choice of the letter ‘t’
used for both quantities is coincident

                                                                                                                      133
Since t is constant length, its derivative t’=β” has
no tangential component, and therefore reflects
purely the variation of the curve’s direction due
to turning of the curve. Differentiation of t • t = 1
yields 2(t’ • t) = 0. Therefore the dot product of t
and t’ is 0, and t’ is always orthogonal to t,
hence normal to the curve β . Since the point of
application of t and t’ are the same – namely the
point of application p = β (s)= α (t), these two
vectors determine a unique plane for the curve          Figure V-10: Normal plane of a curve

at the point of application, termed the osculating plane (Figure V-9). Spatially, this is the
plane that the curve “lies in” at the infinitesimal neighborhood of p. The unit vector in the
direction of t’ is termed the normal vector to the curve, and will be referenced by the bold
letter n, where:


      t′
n=                                                                                       (V.19)
      t′




Similarly, the tangent vector t defines a second plane, normal to the curve at p, called the
normal plane (Figure V-10). The length of the vector t’ determines a numerical measurement
of the curvature of β . The function:


κ (s ) = t ′(s )                                                                         (V.20)

is called the curvature function of β . This scalar
function provides a metric for the way in which
the curve deviates from a straight line at any
point. The function 1/ κ (s ) has a spatial sense,
in that it is the radius of a circle of curvature
equivalent to β at p. A circle whose center is
located a distance positioned 1/ κ (s ) in the
direction of t’ will be pass through p, and follow
the curve β (s) as it curves in the neighborhood
of p.                                                      Figure V-11: Curvature of a curve


A third canonical vector completes the axis
system at p. The binormal vector b is
perpendicular to both t and n. This vector is
defined by the cross product b = t × n and is
thus normal to the osculating plane. The
three vectors b, t, and n are mutually
orthogonal, satisfying the relations:
                                                       Figure V-12: The Frenet frame vectors

Differentiation of b ⋅ b =1 and b ⋅ t =0 yields


b’ ⋅ b = 0                                                                                 (V.22)


since, again, b is a unit vector, and


b’ ⋅ t = -b ⋅ t’ = -b ⋅ κn = -κ(b ⋅ n) = 0                                                 (V.23)


b’ is thus orthogonal to b and t , and is therefore parallel to n. We define the torsion τ of the
curve β (s) as:


                                                                                               135
b’= - τn                                                                                   (V.24)

The torsion of a curve at a point p = β (s)
measures the twisting or winding of the curve, the
rate at which the curve diverges from the
osculating plane at the point. We may extend the
discussion of curvature at a point by describing the
curve in the infinitesimal neighborhood of p       as
having a shape equivalent to a helix with
equivalent curvature to κ(s) and torsion τ(s).


A plane curve in R3 is a curve that lies in a single      Figure V-13: Torsion of a space curve

plane in R3. Intuitively, such a curve never leaves its osculating plane; its torsion must
therefore be uniformly 0.


The derivative n’ of the vector n is similarly orthogonal to n, again by virtue of the fact that n
is by definition a unit vector over β. The vector n’ may therefore be expanded into
components in the directions of t and b. Differentiation yields61:


n’ = -κt + τb                                                                              (V.25)


These derivatives of t, n, and b may be summarized through the Frenet formulas:
t’ =                κn
n’ =    -κt         +         τb                                                           (V.26)
b’ =                -τn


and may be succinctly stated in terms of the skew symmetric matrix of connection forms 62:

The Frenet formulas determine a unique
and significant frame field for the curve
β (s). Drawing on the discussion of
(Section V.C.2), a curve in R3 may be
an imbedding of the 3×1 manifold of R3
vectors (t(t), n(t), b(t)) into the R3×R3×R3
Cartesian product space of all 3-vectors
in   R3.   The       Frenet        frame   field   is
specifically adapted to discussion of
problems concerning the shape of a
curve. The functions κ(s) and τ(s) that                 Figure V-14: The vectors t, n, and b as a vector field
are disclosed by adopting this particular
frame field fully describe the shape of the curve, such that these functions are preserved
over isometric transformations of the curve in R3.


This section has described a particular type of non-Euclidean construct – the curve, and its
imbedding into Euclidean 3-space. Viewed from the perspective of the embedding space, the
curve is a special subset of this space, whose topological structure is obtained by the ability
to map points in this set back to a bounded region I of the real number line R, in a smooth
manner, i.e. continuous and continuously differentiable. As such the curve exhibits the
qualities of a manifold of single dimension, embedded in an R3 space.


Furthermore, the concept of shape functions on the curve were developed. Curvature and
torsion are such shape functions, metrics inherent to the shape of the curve and independent
of the specific parameterization or mapping responsible for the curve’s generation. These

                                                                                                           137
metrics were brought to light by establishing a suitable frame field over the curve in R3, a
frame field defined by reparameterizing the curve by a function of distance along the curve –
the arc length. Finally, the moving frame field was shown as an embedding of a vector space
in R3. These concepts are further extended in considering surfaces, below.

2.         Surfaces in R3
A surface in R3 is defined through a one-to-
one regular mapping σ: M → N of a region M
of R2 into a region N of R3. By convention, we
will call the coordinate parameters in R2 u and
v,    or    equivalently    elements   of   the   2-
dimensional vector u = (u, v), and state that:


x = σ (u)                                    (V.29)


We again consider the Euclidean space R3 to
be the Cartesian product of the real numbered
variables x = (x1, x2, x3). We will colloquially
refer to the R2 specification of the surface as
its   parametric     space    definition,   and   its
mapping into R3 as its occupancy of world
space. For the purposes of defining the                 Figure V-15: Parametric definition of a surface

localized structure of the surface, this mapping
must be regular and one-to-one: derivatives must be available, and the surface must not self
intersect in R3. These restrictions may in turn be overcome by removing portions of the
surface that do not exhibit these properties (critical points, self intersections, etc.) from
consideration in discussing properties of the surface requiring regularity. As in our discussion
of curves in space, the concepts discussed in this section will again spring from a localized
consideration of the surface in a neighborhood of some point on the surface.


Given a mapping function σ and its inverse σ-1, we can uniquely determine a u and v
parametric values for any point on the image of the surface in R3. This one-to-one, invertible
mapping of parametric coordinates onto the surface in R3 provides a coordinate map on the
surface patch; the parameters (u, v) form a coordinate system on the points of the surface

                                                                                                    138
embedded in R3. This definition of a surface specifies the local properties of a point in R3
necessary for its inclusion in a surface. In order for the properties of the surface in R3 to be
understood and defined, it is necessary to work backward from R3 to R2, ensuring that
localized properties for the inverse mapping hold for each point in R3 considered to be on the
surface. A surface in R3 is a subset M of R3 such that for each point x ∈ N we can define a
point in M whose image contains a neighborhood of x in R3.


On one hand, the relationship between coordinate patches and points in R3 is considered
from the perspective of R2, where its behavior is essentially consistent with the Euclidean
nature of a bounded region of R2 space. On the other hand, a surface is specified by
considering its structuring in the neighborhood of points embedded in R3 space.


We will analyze the shape of surfaces from
the localized perspective of individual points
mapped between R2 and R3 spaces as they
survey the structuring of their neighborhoods
in these spaces, and defer on considerations
of the surface’s global nature and properties
until    such        localized           understanding   is
achieved. The essential tool for considering
the shape and structuring of a surface will be
                                                              Figure V-16: The partial derivatives of the surface
to survey its variations of position and other                                    function
vector based metrics near a point on of the surface as other quantities in both parametric or
world space representations are varied. An obvious point of departure for consideration is the
variations of points’ positions in R3 as variations of their dual positions in R2 parametric space
are undertaken. Other more interesting properties of the surface such as curvature and other
shape metrics will in turn be defined on top of these simple variations. This variation among
spatial parameterizations is comprised of six linearly independent functions, one for the
variation produced in each coordinate in the three dimensional vector space x as either of
the Euclidean 2-space parameters u and v are varied. Numerically, these values are limits of
6 ratios:
dx i                ∆x i x i 1 − x i 0
     = lim              =
d u j u i 1 → u j 0 ∆u u j 1 − u j 0                                                                      (V.30)
x i ∈ ( x, y , z ), u j ∈ (u, v )
                                                                                                             139
of each component of the vector ∆x = (x1 – x0) from a point x0 to a second point x1 as x1’s
parametric coordinates (u1 and v1) are varied toward those of x0. The terms σ-u and σ-v refer
to the two R3 vectors dxi/du and dxi/dv,. These vectors are imagined to radiate outward from
the point x0 in R3 (Figure V-17).


These functions may be organized in a 2X3 matrix (the Jacobian matrix) of the function σ,
which may be viewed as an orthonormal expansion of the vectors dx/du and dx/dv in some
Cartesian coordinate field, e.g. a “global coordinate system” x = (x , y , z).

The surface is regular at x0 provided that the location of x in R3 does in fact vary continuously
as u and v vary in the R2 neighborhood of x’s map in D. The derivatives dx/du may not of be
0 magnitude at any point in this neighborhood. Furthermore, the vectors σu and σv must be
linearly independent: they may not be parallel.


If these conditions are met, then σu and σv
define a plane, tangent to the surface at x,
and a vector N normal to the surface at x. The
vectors σu and σv, and any linear combination
of these vectors, are similarly tangent to the
surface at x. The magnitudes (lengths) of
these vectors represent the “speeds” or
partial velocities of a point x‘s travel in R3 as u
and v are varied with unit speed in parametric
space.
                                                      Figure V-17: Tangent plane defined by the
                                                          differentiating the surface function
Note that while the vectors u and v are by definition orthogonal in parametric space (by virtue
of being aligned with the correspond parametric space coordinate axes), the same need not
be true in world space: the vectors σu and σv at x do not necessarily compose a right angle in

                                                                                              140
the plane they define. Significantly, any other parameterization of the surface of the form
(u ,v ) , would have partial velocities σ u ,σ v at x that would necessarily be linear combinations
of σu and σv. Thus σ u and σ v would comprise an identical tangent plane in R3 at x, albeit with

a different parameterization of the plane.


In Section V.D.1, curves in space were presented through a family of parameterizations,
tracing the same curve through space and differing by the speed of the curve’s trajectory
through space as a function of the parameter t. The re-parameterization of these functions to
one based on a unit arc length was identified. Normalizing the curve and its variations with
respect to arc length defined a unique frame field (the Frenet frame) whose variations yielded
shape metrics of the curve (curvature and torsion). These metrics in turn proved to be
characteristics of the shape, invariant over parameterizations. Our consideration of the
metrics defining the shape of a surface will take place along similar lines. We will look for
qualities of the shape independent of its parameterization, and canonical frames of reference
by which to view important shape variations of the surface. The shape of a surface is
specified by qualities defined by its mapping function, viewed through its variations at
localized points on the surface. In contrast to the single value parameterization of the curve,
a surface is described by two parameters. The analogous shape metrics will necessarily take
place by considering variations of these two parameters, both singly and in relation to one
another.


We can extend the analysis of curves from Section V.D.1 to an analysis of surfaces by
considering a member of the family of curves lying on the surface passing through a point x.
The definition of this family of curves is dramatically simplified by considering the curve
initially as lying in the R2 parametric space of surface, then mapping this parametric space
curve into world space by the surface mapping function σ. The curve in parametric space is
represented simply as:


u = u(t)                                                                                    (V.32)
v = v(t)


The parameter t thus sweeps a set of points in parametric space, which in turn are provided
as input to the mapping function of the surface.        We may equivalently say that the R1


                                                                                              141
manifold of the curve’s parameter is transformed and embedded into the R2, Euclidean
parametric space by the mapping function u = α(t). In turn, the embedded curve α(t) in R2 is
embedded in R3 world space as


σ (t) = σ (α(t))                                                                          (V.33)


Holding either u(t) or v(t) constant – the equivalent
of defining a parameter t that varies in one
parametric variable only – produces a “vertical or
horizontal” line in parametric space and an
isoparametric curve in R3. The set of isoparametric
curves traces out a coordinate grid in space. The
tangent to these isoparametric curves is provided
by σu and σv, the 1st derivatives of σ with respect u     Figure V-18: Isoparametric curves on
                                                                         surface
and v, equivalently the tangent vectors of the
isoparametric curves σ(u(t)) and σ(v(t)).


The vectors σu and σv naturally determine a vector normal to the surface and tangent plane,
orthogonal to both σu and σv , by the cross product n = σu × σv :


                                 
              eˆ 1   eˆ 2   eˆ 3 

              ∂v    ∂v     ∂v 




Any parameterization of an equivalent surface will determine a normal vector in the direction
of n. This surface normals established by various surface parameterizations at a point will be
parallel but differ in magnitude, a consequence of the speeds of travel along the surface
established by the specific parameterization. To refine the surface normal’s invariance over
parameterizations, we define a unit length vector normal to the surface:



                                                                                             142

N= n =                                                                                    (V.34)
         σu × σv


This unit normal vector is the first important invariant of surface shape we will encounter. Its
variation over the surface forms an vector field on the surface, providing one component of
an invariant coordinate frame field on the surface, similar to the Frenet frames developed for
space curves in Section V.D.1. To complete this invariant frame field, we will need to seek
out appropriately invariant directions on the surface provided by the shape of the surface as
well.


The parameterization of a curve on the
surface through a point x on the surface
forms a basis for the considering the
variation of surface metrics. We can trace
variations of the surface’s shape as we move
along a curve. Then, drawing on the
coordinate framework established on the
surface, we can consider the expansion of
                                                Figure V-19: The family of surface curves through
surface properties from our knowledge of
                                                                    a point
how the surface acts in these orthogonal
parametric directions.


The arc length of a curve on the surface is found by integrating


ds = dxdx + dydy + dzdz = dσ • dσ                                                         (V.35)


The vector dσ/dt      tangent to the curve may be expanded in terms of the curve’s
parameterization:


dσ      du      dv
   = σu    + σv                                                                           (V.36)
dt      dt      dt


Combining (V.35) and (V.36) results in the first important metric of the shape of surface at a
point:
                                                                                             143

 = (σ u • σu )du 2 + (σ u • σ v )dudv + (σ v • σ v )dv 2


Note that while ds represents the notion of infinitesimal arc length along a curve, the quantity
ds2 represents an infinitesimal area on the surface between two neighboring pairs of
isoparametric curves on the surface, joined by path taken by a curve on the surface σ (t). The
scalar quantities


e = σ u • σu
f = σu • σv                                                                              (V.38)
g = σv • σv


represent measures of this variation of the surface in the neighborhood of x. e          and g
represent the rate of stretch or shrink of the surface as one moves in the direction tangent to
u and v at x, while f measures the rate of shear between these two space vectors.


The quantities e, f, and g represent the first fundamental form of a surface. The quantity
eg − f 2 = (σ u • σ u )(σ v • σ v ) − (σ u • σ v )2
         = (σ u × σ v ) • (σ u × σ v )                                                   (V.39)
                          2
         = (σ u × σ v )

is the magnitude of cross product between the tangent vectors σu and σv.


The first fundamental form gives a metric of the surface, appropriate for considering the
variation of the surface’s shape from the myopic perspective of an ”inhabitant” of surface
situated at point on the surface x. As the inhabitant surveys the terrain of the surface in its
neighborhood, important variations in the plane of the surface may be detected from the
metrics in (V.38), allowing local variations of surface features such as arc length, angle and
areas to be determined.


This localized variation of properties in the plane of the surface is however only part of
description of its shape. The surface form must be considered from the perspective of
variations out of the surface plane as well. We approach this by again considering the path

                                                                                             144
through space of a curve on the surface. In this step, we will consider the relationship of the
Frenet field on the curve at x to the frames established by the surface plane and normal. The
tangent vector to the curve t will lie in the plane of the surface. However, the normal vector of
the curve’s Frenet frame n will likely be in a direction independent from the surface normal
vector N at the point. This stems from the fact that the curve may not only curve with the
direction of the surface, but may simultaneously curve in the plane of the surface as well. In
order to use this curve to establish metrics on the surface’s curvature, we isolate the normal
and tangential components of the curve’s shape from the perspective of the embedding
surface.


We may define an angle γ between the unit length
normal to the curve n and the unit length normal to
the surface N, as:


n • N = cos(γ ) n N = cos(γ )                  (V.40)


The vector n points in the normalized curvature
direction t′ of the curve σ (t). Correspondingly, the
vector N normal to surface provides what seems
                                                         Figure V-20: The angle between surface
intuitively a similar role on the surface. The                     and curve normals
relationship between surface normal and surface curvature is disclosed by considering the
component of the curvature of σ(t) lying in the plane formed by N and the vector t tangent to
curve.


We decompose the curvature of σ(t) into this normal
component and the component in the plane of the
surface, and may visualize this decomposition locally
as two curves in these planes. Curvature in the plane
tangent to the surface is termed the geodesic
curvature of the surface. The normal curvature, out of
the tangent plane and in the plane described by the
tangent to the curve and the surface normal, will be
the focus of consideration in establishing metrics for     Figure V-21: Decomposition of surface

                                                                        components
                                                                                             145
the surface’s curvature. The invariance of this component should be evident; any curve on
the surface with an equivalent tangent at x will be constrained to share this component of
curvature, by virtue of being constrained to the surface at that point. In contrast, the geodesic
curvature of like curves at x will be distinct.


The valuation of the normal curvature at x with a unit tangent vector t is simply the
component of the surface curve’s curvature κ, projected onto the surface’s normal N at x.
This factor is computed as the surface curve’s curvature, multiplied by the cosine of the
angle γ :


κ cos(γ ) = κ n N                                                                          (V.41)


t‘, the 1st derivative of the curve’s unit tangent vector with respect to arc length is defined as
κ n ; therefore (V.41) may be expanded as:


κ cos(γ ) = κ n N
            = t′ N
            = σ ′′ N                                                                       (V.42)
            = (σ u du + σ v dv )′ N
            = (σ uu dudu + 2σ uv dudv + σ vv dvdv + σ u d 2u + σ v d 2v ) N


Since σu and σv are the tangent vectors to the isoparametric curves on the surface, N is by
definition orthogonal to these vectors and σu • N = σv • N = 0. Therefore the last two terms in
(V.42) equal 0, and the equation reduces to the second fundamental form of a surface:


κ cos(γ ) = (σ uu dudu + 2σ uv dudv + σ vv dvdv ) N
                                                                                           (V.43)
            = l dudu + 2m dudv + n dvdv


where


 l = σ uu N
m = σ uv N                                                                                 (V.44)
 n = σ vv N



                                                                                              146
The normal curvature of a curve on the surface κn                    may now be expressed by the
                                        st
components e,f and g from the 1 fundamental form (V.38), and the components of the
second fundamental form l,m and n:

         e dudu + 2f dudv + g dvdv
                                                                                                 (V.45)

   =−
      e + 2f λ + g λ 2


where λ = dv/du , the tangent of the angle curve σ(t) prescribes in the parametric coordinate
plane of σ at u.


Note that the above discussion has reduced
our initial consideration of the family of all
curves lying on σ to consideration of the family
of curves formed by the intersection of the
surface with the pencil of planes in which the
surface normal N lies. The normal curvature
component of any curve on the surface
passing through x will be locally equivalent to
the curvature formed by the intersection of the
surface with the plane formed by the tangent
to the curve and the surface normal.                        Figure V-22: The normal curves at a point



As this plane is rotated about N, the normal curvature κN will vary. Through this rotation, a

maximum and minimum value for κN will be attained for some values of λ. The maximum

and minimum values of κN are termed the principal curvatures of σ at x, and in combination
they uniquely define the local shape of the surface at x. The principal curvatures may be
determined by recognizing that the maxima are when the derivative of κn with respect to λ

equals 0. Differentiating (V.45) with respect to λ yields:


dκ N
     = 0 = (e + 2f λ + g λ 2 )(2m + 2nλ ) − ( l + 2mλ + nλ 2 )(2f + 2g λ )                       (V.46)

Therefore, at the directions of principal curvature:
(e + 2f λ + g λ 2 )(2m + 2nλ ) = (l + 2mλ + nλ 2 )(2f + 2g λ )                                    (V.47)
and
   (2f + 2g λ )        (2m + 2nλ )
                   =                                                                              (V.48)
(e + 2f λ + g λ 2 ) (l + 2mλ + nλ 2 )


Since
(e + 2f λ + g λ 2 ) = (e + f λ ) + λ (f + g λ )
                                                                                                  (V.49)
(l + 2mλ + nλ 2 ) = (l + mλ ) + λ (m + nλ )


substituting (V.45) into (V.48) and undertaking the substitutions in (V.49) yields the equation
for the normal curvatures κN :


                l + mλ    m + nλ
κN = −                 =−                                                                         (V.50)
                e + fλ    f + gλ

Re-ordering yields the two equations, when κn is at its extreme values:


 ( l + κ N e )du + (m + κ N f )dv = 0
                                                                                                  (V.51)

is a useful valuation, representing the geometric mean of the principal curvatures’
magnitudes. Note that on a sphere:


        κN κN         = κN = κN

since κ Nmax = κ Nmin . The value 1/ K provides the radius of a sphere with equivalent gaussian

curvature, a useful reference when considering what a particular gaussian curvature value
represents.


We now consider a number of local surface
conditions discernable from the valuation of
gaussian curvature. First, we may identify
three distinct local conditions of the surface
depending on the sign of the gaussian
curvature at the point. When the sign of κNmax

and κNmin are the same (either both positive or
both negative) the sign of the gaussian
curvature will be positive. Geometrically, this
means the surface curves in the same
direction in the two principal directions.
                                                     Figure V-23: Positive gaussian curvature -
Qualitatively, this corresponds to a shape                      “bowl” configuration

similar to a “dome” (if the surface curves away from the normal direction under consideration)
or a “bowl” (if the direction of curvature is toward the surface normal). The term elliptical is
used to describe this type of localized surface curvature configuration. The absolute values
of the principal curvatures will thus take on a maximum and minimum. The surface will thus
have directions of tightest and weakest curvature, corresponding to the greatest and least
absolute values of the two principal curvatures.

                                                                                             149
The sign of the curvatures κNmax and κNmin will
be dependent on the parameterization of the
surface. If the parameterization is inverted
(where u and v are reversed), the surface
normal n = u × v will be inverted. The direction
of curving will thus be in the opposite direction
relative to n, thus the sign of κNmax and κNmin
will be inverted. However, the sign and
valuation of the gaussian curvature K = κNmax

× κNmin will remain constant regardless of             Figure V-24: Positive gaussian curvature -
                                                                 “dome” configuration
parameterization. We may also recognize
conditions where the principal curvatures are in the same direction and of equivalent value.
In this case, κN is constant as the direction around the point is considered. The point is an
umbilical point, locally spherical.


The surface takes on a qualitatively different
shape    at   points     of   negative    gaussian
curvature. Here the principal curvatures κNmax

and κNmin are necessarily of opposite sign.
The surface curves in opposite directions
along   the   two      principal   directions:   one
direction will curve in the direction of the
surface normal, the other in the opposite
direction. The local shape will have the
characteristics of a “saddle” and is hyperbolic
                                                       Figure V-25: Negative gaussian curvature
at the point. The principal curvatures are in the                    configuration
opposite sense. Consequently, the principal directions both represent directions of tightest
curvature, the two extremes of the curvatures taken on by normal curvatures at the point.


Since the principal curvatures are of opposite signs, and the curvature of the normal sections
vary continuously as the direction of consideration proceeds around the point, there must be
two normal sections where κN = 0; i.e. the normal section is locally linear.
                                                                                               150
Finally, the gaussian curvature may be locally of magnitude 0. Since K = κNmax κNmin this

condition means that either one of either κNmax or κNmin are of magnitude 0, or they both are.

Recall that a curve of curvature 0 is locally straight; The latter case, where both κNmax and

κNmin are of magnitude 0, corresponds to the condition of a surface that is locally planar; the
normal sections in the principal directions, hence in every direction, is straight.


Zero gaussian curvature is also the result when one of the principal curvatures is of
magnitude 0, but the other is not. The normal curvature κN at the point never changes sign,

but varies between the 0 and the maximum curvature established by κNmax. This is referred

to as a surface that is locally parabolic. Since κNmin = 0, the surface corresponds locally to a
line in one of the principal directions. The other principal direction must necessarily be
orthogonal to this direction on the surface. Parabolic surface conditions will have a great role
in the discussion of developable surfaces, to be presented in great detail in Section VI.B.


We can view values of gaussian
curvature as defining a relationship
between pairs of κNmax and κNmin
values. Figure V-26 shows a chart
graphing     constant     values      of
gaussian curvature, with the axes
representing the two principal radii.
Note that this graph is symmetric
about the axis of equivalent radii.
Similarly, we can view a constant
value of gaussian curvature as
defining a family of localized surface
curvature conditions (Figure V-27).

The directions of maximum and minimum curvature, along with the normal, present three
vectors on the surface that are each orthogonal to the other. This fact provides the conditions
for a frame field (Section V.B.3) on the surface. This frame field is an analogue of the
important Frenet frames (V.26) found on curves: a unique coordinate system on the surface,
occurring purely as a result of the shape of the surface at local points and independent of the
parameterization of the surface.


The notion of shape metrics - established on curves through the definition of curvature and
torsion – were extended to surfaces through the definition of principal curvatures and
gaussian curvature. These metrics are properties of the shape of the surface, independent of
parametric description that generates the surface. These properties take the form of vector
fields, defined across the surface manifold. Shape metrics will be drawn on in following
sections to establish criteria for the constructibility of the designed shapes.

3.     Bézier / NURBS formulations
This chapter has established curves and surfaces as special types of topological objects:
manifolds embedded in 3-dimensional space through a mapping from an intrinsic parametric
space that is locally Euclidean. From these topological conditions, shape metrics resulting
from the differential properties of these mappings were identified. These principles were
developed without regard to the specific formulations of the mapping functions, other than
positing assumptions on the order of the mapping function and its differentiability.


In order to interpret these findings into numerical valuations, or simply to describe a specific
object’s inhabitation of R3, numerically evaluatable mapping functions will need to be to
defined. In this section, parametric mapping functions of utility to computer aided design will
be presented, and their ability to support differentiability and other conditions necessary for
shape metric evaluations will be demonstrated.


Classical texts on differential geometry87,47,36 typically present examples of spatial objects in
terms of simple polynomial and trigonometric functions for which differentiation can be
undertaken in a fairly straightforward fashion. For example the curve mapping function:

additional variables in polynomial definition:

curves,           generated       through   variations     of   the

variables a, b, and c. However, the utility of any
such         specific       polynomial      curve     or   surface
formulation is rather limited. The curves in Figure V-28 all have roughly the same shape. If
we are interested in a curve with an even minimally different configuration in space, we need
to adjust the polynomial description of the curve, an operation that is not likely to be
conducive to interactive editing for this simple polynomial approach.


The search for polynomial parametric expressions of more general utility, and improved user
interaction, has resulted in the development of the Bèzier equations, and extensions of these
equations including NURBS (Non-Uniform, Rational B-Splines)64,74,29. These formulations

Where the control points bi , j define an ordered mesh of control points in size i x j.


Parametric curve and surface representations represented through B-spline equations form
the basis for virtually all commercially available CAD representations at this point in time. The
descriptions of paper surface representations currently used in Gehry’s process are similarly
founded on these underlying parametric descriptions. However, it should again be noted that
these representations only specific examples of the set of potential manifold representations
of curved spatial objects. Other representations will be considered in latter parts of this
thesis.

VI. Differential Forms And Applications to Surface Constructibility

In Chapter V, shape metrics were defined as differential properties on shapes, useful for
describing characteristics of the shape. In this chapter applications of shape metrics to
issues of surface constructibility on Gehry projects are discussed. Two substantially different
methodologies for applying shape metrics to guide the development of constructible surface
forms are currently applied in the firm’s digital modeling process. These different approaches
have substantially different implications, both on the qualities of the resulting forms, and the
fabrication systems that are supported.


As a general introduction to the approach, we are interested in establishing some surface
metric that provides a measure of acceptable constructibility conditions. With this measure in
hand, we can assess the project form in terms of its constructibility. If localized unacceptable
conditions are determined, rationalization operations can be conducted to improve the form,
until the constructibility metric on the form is satisfactory. In Section I.A, techniques used by
the firm to apply gaussian curvature metrics as one such measure of constructibility are
described.


Alternatively, we can look to constrained surface representations that by nature guarantees
certain constructibility conditions. By interpreting the project form into assemblies of these
surface elements, the identified constructibility conditions are guaranteed. The processes of
describing the project form through these surface elements is thus unified with the processes
of rationalization. In Section VI.B of this chapter, one such class of surface forms, the
developable surfaces, are described, and their relationship to constructibility requirements
are presented.



A.     CONSTRAINED GAUSSIAN CURVATURE

1.     Introduction
The application of gaussian curvature (Section V.D.2) as a heuristic for surface
constructibility was first used on the Bilbao project, was substantially extended on the
Experience Music Project, and has been in use on projects since that time. These projects
represent paper surface constructibility problems, as described in (Section IV.C). On these

                                                                                             157
projects, fabrication strategies were adopted based on cladding the surface with metallic
sheets, either stainless steel, aluminum or, in the case of Bilbao, titanium. For reasons of
project economics, the assumption was made that the surface form should be fabricated
through assemblies of sheet elements, positioned on a sub-framing system, without requiring
expensive working of the sheet materials through stretch forming or other labor intensive
methods.


At a first, qualitative glance, the notion of surface curvature as a metric for constructibility of
these systems makes some sense. Experience by the firm has shown that some degree of
macro scale surface curvature can be accommodated by these fabrication strategies. Within
some limit of surface curvature, sheet materials can be fastened to a framing system with
insignificant deviation between the sheets and the framing. Within this limit, the effects of
surface curvature on the behavior of the sheets can be ignored.


The qualities of the gaussian curvature metric have a reasonable affinity with what can be
observed in forming sheets in space. We can for example construct a cylinder of quite tight
radius from a metal sheet, by simply rolling it into a form. Analysis discloses zero gaussian
curvature for cylindrical forms. Other canonical forms such as cones have similar properties.
Of course, at some point the material properties of the sheet metal begin to impact this
qualitative assessment of form, since we can not manually roll a thick sheet of plate steel into
a cylinder of any substantially tight radius. But with certain assumptions regarding the
stiffness of the sheet material in place, the sheet’s material behavior can be discounted for
surface forms with zero gaussian curvature. By extension, we presume that some limited,
non-zero surface curvature can be supported by sheet materials as well, and look to identify
a measure of surface curvature that is acceptable given the surface construction.


On further inquiry, this intuitive assumption seems to unravel, when we look to identify
precisely how this surface curvature is assumed by the system, and attempt to determine
empirical metrics for this behavior. An analysis of the behavior of sheet materials seems to
defy the proposition that any substantial curvature can be assumed by sheet elements.
However, a curved surface of substantially large proportions can be covered by relatively
small sheet elements. The ability of the system to “make up” this curvature is difficult to
assess empirically. Some limited curvature may be assumed by in pane stretching of the
material under manual forming. This claim is substantiated by observing the residual

                                                                                              158
deformation of the sheet if it is released from the substrate to which it is fastened. However,
this manual stretch forming is only a small part of the story. Additional macro scale surface
curvature is assumed by the sheet’s buckling into complex configurations with minimal
gaussian curvature as it is forced onto the framing system. The sheet does not assume the
surface form exactly, but deviates somewhat, in a manner dictated by its internal resolution
of the bending forces. Without conducting substantial material analysis for each sheet, the
exact resolution of these forces by the sheet is difficult to predict. However, the results of
these effects can be observed as the sheet is forced onto framing configurations that impose
increasing gaussian curvature. At some point, the edges of the sheet will begin to display
visible buckling. This phenomenon is highly dependent on sheet dimensions, fastening
strategies, and material properties. Efforts to control these imperfections by orienting panels
either with or against the direction of maximal surface curvature have been inconclusive.


Macro scale gaussian curvature may also be resolved in the fabricated assembly by
discontinuities between adjoining sheet elements. Neighboring sheets will deviate slightly
from one another in continuity or tangency. Small scale buckling independently assumed by
each of the sheets will result in some discontinuity between the sheets. This discontinuity
may have system fabrication or performance implications, and must remain within
established construction tolerances for the system.


As difficult as it is to establish the precise mechanisms by which surface curvature is
resolved by the fabrication system, the degree of imperfection allowable in a surface system
is similarly difficult to determine. When sheet materials are part of the waterproofing strategy
for the project, the allowable discontinuities between sheets must be kept to a minimum. On
many of the firm’s projects, surface fabrication strategies are employed that use several
layers of sheet materials, each with different material behaviors, sheet sizes, and
performance requirements.


In practice, it has often been the desired aesthetic qualities of the finish surface that have
determined the tolerance for imperfections of surface smoothness and the corresponding
degree of allowable surface curvature. The wrinkling of the titanium shingles on the Bilbao
project was part of the desired aesthetic; the curvature considerations on this project were
driven by constructibility requirements of the steel back pan sub-system. On the Experience


                                                                                            159
Music project, curvature considerations were driven largely by the desire for a smooth finish
surface.


An empirical analysis of this wide range of
phenomena and performance requirements –
as they play out on the infinitely variable local
conditions of the project form has not been
practical on Gehry’s projects to date. In
practice, gaussian curvature has proven to be
a    reasonable      heuristic         of      surface
constructibility, encompassing all of these
complex phenomena into one simple metric.
Part of the strategy in adopting gaussian
curvature to measure surface constructibility

gaussian curvature metric. Typically, mock up
studies of a surface system will be conducted
on the basis of maximum anticipated gaussian
curvature.   The   mockups       are        tested   for
conformance to performance requirements,
and the qualities of the finish surface are
inspected. If the mockup is deemed successful
on the basis of this assessment, the gaussian
curvature exhibited by the digital rendition of
the mockup provides a bench mark. The
maximum acceptable surface curvature for the                Figure VI-2: Acceptable and unacceptable
                                                                     curvature configurations
project at large may be stepped back to more
conservative values, to allow a factor of safety.


When surface curvature is detected in the design surface that exceeds the established
curvature values for the project, the project form must be rationalized to reduce this
curvature. Several techniques have been developed to address surface conditions where
curvature constraints are not met. The simplest and most effective of these techniques is to
break the surface and introduce tangency discontinues. These tangent discontinuity features

                                                                                                   160
are addressed in fabrication as breaks between neighboring panels (Figure VI-3). This
tangency discontinuity will have potential design and constructibility implications. A detail for
the connection of surface sheets across a tangency discontinuity must be established. This
detail may be more expensive than the typical condition of surface continuity, and there may
be fabrication limitations on where this condition can be applied. The introduction of tangency
discontinuities will of course have an impact on the design qualities, so rationalization
exercises must be conducted with the input of project designers.

2.      Applications on the Experience Music Project
The Experience Music Project (EMP, 1995-2000)
represents the clearest and most ambitious example
of the constrained curvature approach to surface
rationalization. EMP was begun by Gehry Partners in
1995, with construction completed in May, 2000. The
story of the project’s surface form development and
subsequent rationalization stems from a sequenced
resolution   of   the   project’s    design    intent   with
constructibility decisions, undertaken on a fast track
construction schedule.


The project is a multi-use facility, incorporating
exhibits and multimedia rides surrounding the theme
of music, as well as facilities for a music archive and
foundation, as well as a variety of programs for music
                                                               Figure VI-4: EMP site model
education. Initial discussions with the client focused
the direction of the design on themes surrounding the energy and imagery of rock & roll. An
important reference to the client was to pay homage to Jimi Hendrix, a Seattle native and
founding influence of 1960s rock and roll. The theme of the electric guitar and in particular
the image of Hendrix’ smashing guitars on stage in the 1960s became one of the guiding
references for the project. Gehry responded to the mixed use nature of the by disaggregating
the facility into seven distinct objects. Each of the elements takes on the colors of a
historically significant type of electric guitar.


As is typical in Gehry’s design process, several alternative schemes were presented to the
client during schematic design. Among the options presented were sketch models fabricated
from plasticene materials, with more smoothly continuous surfaces than had previously been
attempted by the firm. The client expressed a strong preference for these “swoopy”, free form
shapes. With this design direction in hand, the architectural team began a series of feasibility
studies intended to develop surface fabrication systems supporting these highly curved
shapes.




                                                                                             162
The   design   team    initially   established   a
fabrication strategy using terrazzo, covering
relatively large (10’ X 20’) panels of pre-
fabricated concrete. The terrazzo material
would be colored and finished with embedded
glass aggregate to approach the glittery finish
of guitars. During this time, the final shape of
the building was being completed and project
computer models were produced from the
physical design models (Figure VI-6). These            Figure VI-5: Terrazzo mockup (EMP)
computer models were generated on the
assumption that the final surface would take on the form of generally continuous surfaces
over the body of each element.


The project schedule required that the primary structure be engineered before the relatively
difficult problem of engineering the building surface system was completed. The structural
engineer elected to construct the primary structural system out of curved, plate built up ribs,
which would follow the general form of the finish surface. The structural ribs sliced the
elements in an orthogonal arrangement, spaced 10’ apart. To accommodate the as yet
undetermined cladding system, a 24” offset zone was left between the outside finish surface
and the exterior of the structural rib assembly. In highly formed areas, the rib system broke
away from the outside surface form, anticipating a potentially substantially thicker surface
assembly in these regions.


Mid way through design development, the terrazzo on concrete paneling approach was
abandoned. This decision was largely based on economic factors. The terrazzo finish system
was deemed to be prohibitively expensive, largely due to the labor intensive finishing of the
terrazzo material. Instead, the decision was made to develop the building enclosure system
based on a sheet metal cladded finish, similar to the systems that had recently proven
successful on the Guggenheim Bilbao. However, unlike the Bilbao finish, the surface quality
desired of the EMP project was to be smooth, recalling the imagery of the curved metal finish
on airplane bodies. The architecture team considered the fabrication techniques of airplane
bodies, where portions of the skin shapes are produced by limited deformation of sheet metal


                                                                                            163
surfaces, while other more highly shaped areas (such as the nose cone of an airplane) are
mass produced by stretch forming.

            Figure VI-7: EMP design after rationalization for cladded surface construction


At this point, the sheet metal fabricator A. Zahner & Company (AZCO) was brought on to the
construction team. Discussions ensued between the architecture team and the fabricating
engineers to re-interpret the building shape into fabricatable sheet metal elements. It was
known at the time that the CAD models – incorporating continuous free form surfaces –
would have to be modified to substantially remove the double curvature in the form.
However, the team had limited heuristics for determining what would be acceptable
curvatures, and the economic implications of varying types of double curved surfaces. In the
bid documents33 provided to AZCO, a distinction was made between two types of surface
systems: a “typical system” where presumptions of limited surface curvature could be made
and where the project form would be subjected to the limitations of simply folded sheet metal
materials, and “highly shaped areas” which might require additional forming of the metal
material.

                                                                                             164
AZCO began a series of tests to determine the limits of gaussian curvature that could be
supported on the typical system. A test bed was built, allowing combinations of surface
curvatures to be evaluated. On this test bed, a series of threaded rods were positioned
relative to pre-cut templates defining arcs of a given radius. Once the test bed was set up
with a given combination of radii, sheets of finish metal were pressed on the surface of the
bed. Based on the buckling of the material during the test, a pass or fail grade was
established for each curvature combination.


With this data of acceptable and unacceptable curvature pairs in hand, a function
representing the cut-off between acceptable and failed curvatures was developed. Three
categories of surface conditions were tested: a “dome” condition corresponding to convex
positive curvature, a “bowl” condition representing concave positive curvature, and a “saddle”
configuration representing negative curvature. The distinction between convex and concave
positive curvatures was established due to AZCO’s perception that concave configurations
would be more difficult to force the sheet material onto than convex forms. Figure VI-8 shows
the results of these studies. Ultimately, the ease of using gaussian curvature analysis
capabilities available in CATIA led the team to select a gaussian curvature metric slightly
more conservative than the function established directly by AZCO’s studies.




                                                                                          165

Gehry Partners’ CATIA modelers were thus faced with the task of rationalizing the original,
smooth surface model into conformance with the gaussian curvature test. The team went
back to the physical model, digitized the edge curves of the actual paper panels on the
physical model, and projected these curves onto the computer surface model. These curves
served as guidelines for the locations of tangent discontinuities for breaking up the CAD
model to reduce curvature where necessary. Figure VI-9 shows the results of this
rationalization operation on the typical system areas for Element 7.

3.      Summary
By in large, the gaussian curvature metric established for the project has served its intended
function. The typical system areas required no additional forming of the finish materials, and
generally the fabrication assumptions in the design of the panel system posed few
unanticipated complications. However, a few unanticipated problems were encountered on
relatively high curvature areas when pre-punched holes did not line up correctly on
neighboring face sheets. Fabrication strategies where sheet materials form the waterproofing
membrane must obviously require a heightened level of attention to poor inter-sheet
continuity.


There are some important characteristics
inherent to any fabrication strategy adopted on
constrained curvature forms. These surfaces
are by nature bi-directionally curved, even if
this   curvature    is   limited.   Thus,    framing
strategies    for   supporting      the     surfacing
materials must be curved in at least one
direction. On several projects including EMP,
panel assemblies have provided the sub-
framing technology (Figure VI-10). On EMP,
these panels were developed from planar
sheet materials. The top edge of each framing
                                                        Figure VI-10: AZCO’s panel system
member or “fin” is CNC cut to reflect the
curvature of the surface along its profile. Thus,
the panel itself provides the dimensional control of the surface, on the basis of surface
dimensional data provided by the digital master model. Additional discussion of the
development of the panel system and layout are presented in Part 3, below.


The constrained gaussian curvature approach employs surface curvature metrics inherent to
differential surface representations as a predictor of surface constructibility. The surface
elements are represented by the software as Bézier and NURBS surfaces, discussed in
Section V.D.3 above. Many available NURBS modeling packages provide utilities for
visualizing and analyzing gaussian curvature on surfaces. During rationalizing activities, CAD



                                                                                            168
operators have simply to check the curvature readouts of the software against these
established limits.


Unfortunately, the constraints and controls inherent to these surface representations do not
map particularly well to those of paper surfaces. NURBS based formalisms have been
developed to support a much larger class of continuously smooth surfaces. The available
controls for positioning and shaping NURBS surfaces provide little guidance for efforts to
develop constrained curvature configurations. The operator must address the gaussian
curvature constraint “manually”, by manipulating the surface form until the desired surface
curvature has been achieved. Ironically, the class of NURBS surfaces is built on a geometric
representation that is less constrained than desirable, or not constrained appropriately for the
task. In the next section, alternative surface representations will be described where these
constraints are more directly imposed by the surface representation.

B.     DEVELOPABLE SURFACES

1.     Introduction
The   previous        discussion    presented     the
concept of surface (gaussian) curvature as a
useful metric for assessing the constructibility
of surfaces. Its limitations as a true predictor
of the behavior of sheet material and system
behaviors    were      discussed.     An     essential
limitation of the technique is that we can not
truly expect sheet metal or other sheet
material surfaces to adopt any measurable
gaussian curvature in their configuration,
without some substantial degree of in plane
deformation of the surface occurring.


There exists a special class of developable
surfaces, which guarantee zero gaussian
curvature, despite the existence of substantial
and variable normal (out of plane) curvature.
Consequently, developable surfaces can be
unrolled into a flat plane configuration with no
deformation “in the plane” of the surface. The
potential    applications     of      such    surface
constructs in fabrication are readily apparent,
for this is the behavior that we expect of a
sheet of fabricated surface material: the ability
to fold and unfold into the shape of the
surface     without     stretching.     Developable

Developable surfaces map isometrically and conformally22 to a planar surface, in that arc
lengths of curves and angles between curves on the developable surface and its unfolded
configuration are equal. The notion of a plane, continually folded in space up to the
configuration of a developable surface should be kept firmly in mind, for the definition of
developable surfaces will indeed result in configuration of planes “rolled” into space.


One important consequence of this rolled
plane configuration is the existence of
straight lines of ruling on the surface,
where the surface normals at any two
points on a given line of ruling are
parallel. Spatially, we can envision these
lines of ruling as infinitesimally spaced
hinges along which the surface can
unfold without otherwise changing in
shape (Figure VI-11). This existence of a
straight line of ruling with invariant Figure VI-12: Parallel normal vectors on a developable
surface normal is the basis for a                                  surface

differential definition of developable surfaces, below. The following represent equivalent
definitions of conditions on developable surfaces:


   •   The mapping of a developable surface onto a plane is isometric and conformal
   •   A surface whose gaussian curvature is zero
   •   A straight line of ruling exists on each point of the surface; a principal direction with 0
       curvature is aligned with this line of ruling.
   •   The surface normals along a line of ruling are parallel.


In previous sections, the focus of discussion was the establishment of localized differential
properties of surfaces as a specific point of consideration. In moving forward with a
presentation of the definition of developable surfaces, we will again begin by considering the
localized conditions of developable surfaces at a point. However, in addition, this localized
consideration will be extended to the properties of surfaces “in large”, and the means by
which developable properties of surfaces can be guaranteed over the extent of the surface.



                                                                                              171
The definition of gaussian curvature, established in (V.53), was:


κ GAUSS = κ N κ N
            max     min




In order for κGAUSS to be equal to zero, necessarily at least one of the principal curvatures
must be of 0 magnitude. The geometric interpretation of a curve with 0 curvature is of course
a straight line. However, the existence of a localized straight line condition at points on the
surface will not be a sufficient condition to guarantee developability. The previous discussion
of surface curvature disclosed that a local straight line on the surface existed at every point
of negative curvature. We consider initially the class of surface forms generated as a family
of straight line isoparametric curves in one of their directions, and then subsequently
consider the conditions required to guarantee that a principal direction “lines up” with this
isoparametric curve on the surface at large. Elements of this general formulation are drawn
from Kreysig47 and Chalfant19.



2.      Ruled Surfaces
We begin by defining the class of surfaces generated by a straight line in one of its
parametric directions. The class of ruled surfaces is defined as a surface with at least a one
parameter family of straight lines as the isoparametric curves that generate the surface. We
might initially revisit our discussion of parametric surfaces to consider where this requirement
will be defined. The Euclidean nature of the R2 parametric (u,v) space is unaltered by this
requirement. The impact of this condition is felt in the qualities of the resulting, embedded
surface in R3. However, the locus of this constraint is in the embedding R2 → R3 function
itself. Our definition of ruled surface must thus define constraints on the mapping function
that results in this straight line condition observable on the embedded surface in R3.


By convention, for the purposes of consistency in this discussion, we will consider the
parameter v to be the parameter that traces a line in R3 as its value is traversed.
Geometrically, we may envision a ruled surface as the surface described by the path of a
straight line as it is travels through space. The resulting straight lines embedded in space are
termed the generatrices of the ruled surface. In turn, the path taken by the line as it travels
through space may be envisioned as a curve in space, termed the directrix of the surface48.




                                                                                            172
We may thus reformulate the parametric
surface mapping function solely in terms of the
directrix curve α(u) and the distance along unit
vector β(u), whose direction in space is a
function of the distance along the directrix curve
(Figure VI-13):


σ (u,v) = α(u) + vβ(u)                                (VI.1)
                                                               Figure VI-13: Basic ruled surface definition

The vector β may be pictured as a vector field
whose direction in space is a function of u,
while α(u) may be viewed as a curve in space
to which this vector space is applied (Figure
VI-14). Given this parameterization, we may
consider        the      shape       of   the   surface   by
considering the variation of the vectors α(u) –
the directrix curve and its derivatives the
tangent and normal vectors, and the variations
of the generator vector β(u). We consider these                Figure VI-14: Ruled surface as a vector field

vectors in a coordinate system whose origin is at a point on the surface, σ(u,v).
Differentiating σ in (VI.1) with respect to u and v yields:


σ u (u, v ) = α& (u ) + v β& (u )
σ v (u, v ) = β (u )
σ uu (u, v ) = α&&(u ) + v β&&(u )                                                                     (VI.2)
σ uv (u, v ) = β& (u )
σ vv (u, v ) = 0

From the first fundamental form (V.39) eg − f 2 = (σ u × σ v ) the surface normal is:




                                                                                                         173

for all ruled surfaces. Gaussian curvature was defined as (V.52)
              ln − m 2
κ GAUSS =
              eg − f 2


where (V.44):
  l = σ uu N
 m = σ uv N
 n = σ vv N

For ruled surfaces of the form (VI.1) n = σ vv N = 0 , since by definition the generators do not
change direction along v. Curvature is thus reduced to the form
               −m 2
κ GAUSS =
              eg − f 2
              (σ uv N)

          =                                                                                (VI.4)

          =
                   ( eg − f ) 2 2



In this equation, the vector α& is the tangent vector to the directrix curve, β (u ) the vector

along the ruling line or generatrix, β& (u ) the vector representing the change in the generatrix
vector as traversal of the parametric variable u is undertaken.


Our previous discussion of surface curvature established gaussian curvature as an important
metric of the “paperness” of surface forms. The existence of substantial gaussian curvature
is the feature of surface forms that prohibits their assuming flattened shapes without in plane
deformation. We now establish the conditions under which ruled surfaces guarantee the


                                                                                             174
absence of such bi-directional surface curvature. Equation (VI.4) provides the necessary
conditions for zero gaussian curvature of ruled surfaces:


σ uv N = β& (u ) α& (u ) × β (u ) = α& β β& = 0                                                     (VI.5)


Geometrically, we may state that if the
mixed partial derivative σ uv varies only
in    the     plane       of    the      surface
(perpendicular to the surface normal),
zero gaussian curvature and hence
developability           conditions           are
guaranteed. In turn, this condition is
guaranteed        if   the     three     vectors
α& , β ,andβ& are co-planar.

3.       Canonic Forms
The conditions expressed in (VI.5)

specify a constraint on the relative                                 parametric surfaces

variations of the directrix curve and the
generatrix vector necessary for developability. As such, this condition provides a “test” for
parametric surfaces of ruled form. If the above stated condition follows from the specific
parametric form of the ruled surface, then developability is assured. We now present the
possible constraints on ruled surfaces that guarantee global conformance of the surface with
the condition (VI.5).


We begin by reviewing the “normalized” arc-length curve form of the directrix curve α and the
Frenet vector field coordinate field that this parameterization disclosed (Section V.D.1). We
may take each of the frame vectors of the curve α(u) and reapply it as the vector β(u) to
describe a ruled surface uniquely determined by the shape of the curve and its variations in
space. These canonical (tangent, normal and binormal) surfaces of α allow relations between
the vector fields α and β to be globally defined for the ruled surface. We consider each of
these surfaces to identify characteristics of the ruled surface guaranteeing developability
conditions.


                                                                                                      175
                   A. Space curve                                    B. Tangent surface

                           Figure VI-16: Space curve and Frenet field surfaces


In the case of the tangent surface (Figure VI-16B), the generatrix vector β is the tangent t of

the curve α, hence β = α& . The determinant of the matrix α& β β& = α& α& β& is necessarily 0,

since two of the columns are equal. Thus the tangent surface of any space curve is a
developable surface. Tangent developable surfaces are an important class of developable
surfaces for potential consideration in developable surface applications. These surfaces will
be considered further below.



Next we apply the principal normal vector, and consider the conditions on the space curve
required to guarantee developability of the resulting ruled surface (Figure VI-16C). From
(VI.5) and (V.26):


α& β β& = α& n n& = α& n ( −κ t + τ b ) = α& n τ b                                         (VI.6)




                                                                                            176
The three vectors α& , n, and τ b are linearly independent, but the determinant of the matrix will

equal 0 if the torsion τ of the space curve is everywhere zero, since the final column of the
matrix will be 0 in this case. A space curve with torsion equal to zero everywhere lies in a
plane; the normal vector n will universally lie in the plane as well, and the resulting surface is,
trivially, a region of the plane inhabited by the curve α(u).


Finally, we consider the binormal vector of the curve, and note that in this case:


α& β β& = α& b b& = α& b − τ n                                                               (VI.7)


Again, the determinant vanishes again in the case that the torsion of the space curve is 0
and the curve lies in a plane. Geometrically, the binormal vector is orthogonal to the plane of
the curve, and we have the case of a generalized cylinder, extruded in the direction normal to
the plane of the curve.


We note a final, canonical ruled surface whose developability is assured: a cone where all
generatrix vectors pass through a common point in space. In this case, the generatrix is the
vector from points on the space curve α(u) to a fixed point c. The normalized vector β(u) is:


       α −c
β=
       α −c
                                                                                             (VI.8)
        α&
β& =
       α −c


and the matrix determinant is:

                  α&
α& β β& = α& β          =0                                                                   (VI.9)
                 α −c

since α& and β& are linearly dependent.


The previous discussion has identified four canonical developable surfaces forms, derived
from ruled surfaces, upon which developability can be guaranteed:




                                                                                              177

   2. Cylindrical surfaces, where the generatrix is always parallel over the surface,
   3. Conic surfaces, where the generatrix passes through a common point,
   4. Tangent developable surfaces, described by the tangent vector of the space curve at
       each point.

Theoretically49, any developable surface may be decomposed into surface sections from one
of these four classes. Figure VI-18A presents such a composition, while Figure VI-18F
shows the underlying cylinder, cones, plane and tangent developable patches generating the
developable surface.




                                                                                            178
There are, however, some fairly stringent
restrictions on the surfaces that can be
constructed as compositions of these basic
developable surface types, which make
developable surfaces a difficult class of
surfaces to model with. These restrictions
are manifested as infeasible or degenerate
conditions     on       the     surfaces          that    are             A. A developable surface
generated     through          one     of       the    above

As an example, consider what happens if
we    attempt       to        extend        the       tangent
developable surface shown in Figure VI-18D
to the left, beyond the directrix curve α(u).

first one. The directrix curve represents a
location of degeneracy of the developable
surface,     and    is    termed          the     edge     of
regression. There is no other possible
developable surface that can join our original
surface in tangency at this edge. A similar
such degenerate feature is found at the
vertex of the conic developable surface
(Figure VI-18B).

locations of inflection points found in the composition shown in Figure VI-18F, between
adjoining patches, are similar sources of discontinuities. These features are not found
directly in other approaches to the modeling of paper surfaces such the constrained gaussian
curvature approach, or modeling through physical means. However, other analogous
constraints exist. In physical modeling, attempts to force a sheet of paper into an infeasible
configuration will result in crinkling, buckling or tearing of the paper. In the developable
surface approach, these “catastrophic” actions are manifested in infeasible conditions of the
numerical approach, due to the stringent requirement of 0 gaussian curvature on the
differential forms developed in (VI.1) and (VI.5).

4.     Numerical Approaches
The question of providing useful CAD applications to produce developable surfaces has
received substantial study 9,11,19,30,67,68. The general approach of approximating
developable surfaces as sequences of constrained canonic forms has been described
above. Other numerical solutions take a related approach, in generating developable
surfaces as the limit case of these individual classes of developable patches.


We may describe a ruled surface as the
family of lines that join two space curves.
From Section V.D.1, we may reparameterize
these two curves to be generated from a
common parameter that varies along the
lengths of the curves. If we define the two
curves as α1(u) and α2(u), we may define a
line that joins the two points on these curves
at a given value of u. The distance along this
straight line is simply a weighted “blending” Figure VI-20: Ruled surface defined by edge curves
of the points α1(u) and α2(u):


σ(u,v) = (1 - v) α1(u) + v α2(u)                                                         (VI.10)


This parameterization is equivalent to (VI.1) if we define:




                                                                                            180
α ( u ) = α1 ( u )
           α 2 ( u ) − α1 ( u )                                                                 (VI.11)
β (u ) =
           α 2 ( u ) − α1 ( u )


Several CAD applications support the generation of developable surfaces between input
edge curves. Rather than develop the surface into explicitly defined conic, cylindrical and
planar elements, this algorithm approximates a developable surface joining the edge curves
as a ruled surface, and finds ruling directions on the edge curves such that (VI.5) is satisfied.
The algorithm begins on one edge curve α1(u0), and “searches” for points on the opposing

curve α2(u0’ ) such that the tangent vectors α&1(u0 ) and α& 2 (u0′ ) , and the vector α2(u0’ ) -

α1(u0) all lie in a plane, and are thus linearly dependent. The algorithm repeats this search
for all points on the two directrix curves, proceeding in a directed fashion along the two
curves. The algorithm steps along the curves at sufficiently short intervals such that a ruled
surface generated between successive ruling lines in the software’s native (Bézier, NURB)
surface formulation lies within some small tolerance of the input curves.


The edge curves of the physically modeled
paper sheet are the most prominent features
digitized as part of the digital reconstruction of
paper surfaces. Many techniques for the
creation of developable surfaces, including
that utilized in the CATIA DEVELOP module,
provide control of the developable surface by
these edge curves. However, in the general
case,      it   is    impossible   to   construct   a
developable surface from two arbitrary curves
in space. A simple example is presented in
                                                        Figure VI-21: Input edge curves resulting in an
(Figure VI-21). There is no singe developable              infeasible developable surface condition
patch which can match these curves, nor are
there a set of patches with tangency continuity which can. The curves may be joined by a
series of tangent developable surfaces and cones, with a common line of ruling at their joint.
However, these patches will in general have a discontinuity in surface tangency at their joint.
Again, this problem has an analogue in the physical modeling realm. If we attempt to force a

sheet of material over two curves in space, in general the material will not be able to comply
without some wrinkling or buckling, or deviation from the desired input.


The use of guide curves derived from digitized physical paper surfaces provides a good point
of departure for this approach, since these curves are often closely approximate
developable surface directrix curves as a consequence of their materially guided behavior.
However, even limited distortion of these guide curves – including that generated by
digitizing tolerances or crinkling of the material paper – will produce infeasible conditions.
The process of rationalizing digitized edge features into acceptably continuous developable
surfaces is a time consuming process requiring skilled CAD operators. The CAD operators
must “straighten out” one or both of the edge curves, to generate the planarity condition
required by (VI.5) .


Additionally, the edge curve generation approach
presumes a straight line along two of the
surfaces’ edges. In practice, this is almost never
the case on physical material sheets, where all
edges typically are curved. On inspection, it is
evident that a single material sheet theoretically
assumes a complex configuration of multiple
developable patches, joined in tangency along
their ruling lines (Figure VI-22). The reconstruction
of this composition of patches for each sheet of
physically modeled material places an additional
burden on the CAD modeling effort.


The pursuit of improved methods for modeling
developable surfaces has been a focus of
research efforts by the firm. The assessment of
edge   curve    developable    surface   generation

provided above discloses a key limitation of this
                                                                        regions
approach: the input controls (the edge curves) are

ill suited to the solution, since these controls essentially guarantee infeasible conditions.
Furthermore, when infeasible conditions are encountered, there is poor feedback to guide
the operator toward improved conditions.


Often, the ruling lines on the physical surfaces are digitized in addition to the edge curves
(Figure III-11A). These ruling lines provide a good indication of the “flow” of the developable
surface, not apparent simply in the edge features. We can turn the problem around, and
consider these ruling lines to be the primary input controls to developable surface algorithms.


The formulation of developable surfaces as constraints on (1 × n ) Bézier or NURBS surfaces
has been pursued by several researchers3,19,9,11,68,67. Note that an order 1 curve in the u
direction guarantees a ruled surface. The two sets of control vertices (0,0…n-1) and (1,0…n-
1) describe the edge curves to the surface as in (VI.10) above. The problem now becomes
one of identifying the relative positions of control points in space that guarantee invariance of
surface normal along lines of ruling, and providing these constraints to the user in an intuitive
and interactive way. Lang and Röschel50 provide the key constraints on Bézier surfaces
guaranteeing developable conditions:
det ( x ( 0, v ) , x (1, v ) , xu ( 0, v ) , xu (1, v ) ) = 0   ∀v ∈ [0,1]               (VI.12)


and derive a set of five equations satisfying this condition for weighted Bézier surfaces of
order (1,2):
δ 0101 = 0
δ 0102 + δ 0201 = 0
δ 0202 + δ 0112 + δ 01201 = 0                                                            (VI.13)
δ 0212 + δ 1202 = 0
δ 1212 = 0
where δ ijkl is the determinate of four control vertices’ locations and weights:

δ ijkl = pw0 i pw0 j p1wk p1wl Bijkl

This equation can be distilled down to two basic conditions on the weighted control points of
quadratic Bézier.
1. Successive pairs of (4) control points form a “ladder” configuration, where the four control
   points describe a plane.
2. The         weights         of   the    six    control       points   result    in       a   proportional    triple,
    (pw00 : pw01 : pw02 ) = (p10
                              w     w
                                 : p11    w
                                       : p12                                                    w
                                             ) . Given values for the weights pw00 , pw02 ,and p10 , and
   predefined x,y,z locations for all vertices, we can solve for the remaining weights to
   ensure developability of the surface. A quadratic equation determines the necessary
   weight on the intermediate vertex pw01 :

                                     B0201B0202B0212

                            B0201B0112B1202 + B1201B0212B0102
                          w       w
   The remaining weights p11,and p12 can now be determined from the proportional triple,
   above.


This formulation furthermore provides a test for the feasibility of constructing a developable

                                                                                  ( )
                                                                                        2
surface based on the input vertices’ locations. If the quantity pw01                        defined in (VI.15) is less

than zero, then the square root will not be a real number, and the vertex locations can not
produce a developable surface.


On the basis of this approach, an approach to the interactive construction of developable
surfaces has been created (Figure VI-23). In Figure VI-23A, the basic (1,2) developable
surface patch is shown. We distinguish between the two pairs of edge vertices, shown in
green, and the pair of intermediate vertices, shown in blue. Any of these vertices can be
manipulated interactively. The solver dynamically adjusts the locations of the other five
vertices to ensure a ladder configuration, and solves the quadratic equation (VI.15) to
determine the required vertex weights. More elaborate developable surface configurations
are supported as sequences of these basic developable patches. The patches are
constructed by associating the end vertex pair of an original patch with the beginning pair of
a subsequent patch (Figure VI-23B). A planarity condition is imposed on last four vertices of
the previous patch and the first four vertices of the subsequent patch, to ensure tangency at
the seam.

Modifying one of the edge vertices of this assembly results in a variation in the shape of the
edge curve (Figure VI-23C) while moving an intermediate vertex adjusts the tangency of the
surface at the neighboring edge vertices (Figure VI-23D).


The developed space of the configuration is also dynamically computed. Figure VI-23E
shows a view of this unfolded space on the surface of the developable assembly.


Infeasible developable conditions can still be imposed in this interface. If the user moves a
control point to a location resulting in an infeasible condition on one or more of the
developable patches, the infeasible patches are highlighted to alert the user, and a simple
ruled surface is constructed over the region (Figure VI-23F). The user receives dynamic
feedback of this condition, and can reposition the vertex to remove the infeasible condition.



                                                                                           186
This application demonstrates the possibility of constructing developable surfaces by
controlling the ruling lines, as opposed to the edge curves. These features have a more
direct relationship to the developable surface conditions than edge curves. As a result, user
interactions can usually produce quality developable surfaces. Figure VI-24 shows some
developable surface constructions, and analogous designed surfaces.

5.     Developable Surface Applications on the Construction of the Weatherhead
       Project


The    Peter   B.      Lewis     Building   of   the
Weatherhead School of Management at Case
Western Reserve University is perhaps the
most   ambitious       example     of   developable
surface based construction to date. Previous
projects had employed developable surface as
one    means     for    generating      constrained
gaussian curvature forms during rationalization
modeling. Weatherhead takes a radically
                                                       Figure VI-25: Weatherhead project design model
different approach, using the straight lines of
ruling found on developable surfaces as a principal element of system constructibility
strategies.


The project construction is comprised of three major systems73. A cast in place concrete slab
and column system defines the primary structure of the project. The exterior walls of the
project are similarly cast in place concrete, finished in brick, and define a fairly simple
rectangular form with some areas of surface curvature at the top of the walls. The concrete
structure forms a three sided enclosure around an atrium in the center of the project.


A structural steel system is supported on the concrete slab system, generating the external
curved metal forms of the project. The steel enclosure system cascades over the concrete
structure, and descends down to ground level on the open side of the atrium. Two towers of
class rooms stand in the middle of the atrium. These “Buddha” towers, and other interior
surfaces of the atrium, are finished with a lath and plaster system. All three of these systems




                                                                                                 187
are generated from rationalized developable surface forms, and make some use of surface
lines of ruling in different ways.


Efficiencies of construction had to be found to meet the academic institutional budget of the
project. Two guiding intentions were employed in the development of project systems as a
means for reducing the project cost while still achieving the ambitions for the project form.




One innovative cost saving measure was to remove a secondary system strategy that had
been prevalently used on many prior projects. On projects including the Guggenheim Bilbao
and the Experience Music Project, the primary steel system only approximated the design
surface (Section III.F). The actual dimensional control system for these projects was
achieved through an additional system between the primary structure and the finish surface
enclosure. On the Guggenheim project, the dimensional control system is developed through
a series of template curved tubes that are attached to the primary system. On the EMP
project the finish form is achieved by a shaped panel system, attached to the primary
structural steel rib system by adjustable connections.


The Weatherhead cladding system removes the need for a secondary steel system, drawing
on the primary structural steel directly as both the support and dimensional control system for
the surface cladding. This strategy reduced the material and labor costs associated with an
additional system, but placed additional requirements on the tolerances and positioning of
the primary structural system.


With this strategy for the structure and dimensional definition of the surface system, a second
efficiency was enabled. The developable characteristics of the surface guaranteed that
straight geometry occurred in at least one direction on the curved surface. This vast
simplification of the form’s construction allowed the final surface system to be constructed in
the field, through low tech, manual construction methods performed directly on the building
surface. To enable these efficiencies, strictly developable surfaces would be required for all
project forms. The design surface model was rationalized in light of this requirement.


Rationalization of the project into purely developable forms proved to be an enormous
challenge. The strict limitations on surface forms imposed by developable surface


                                                                                                188

geometries were difficult and time consuming to reconcile with the project design. Often, the
developable surface rationalization required re-interpretation of the design surface found
unacceptable by the project designers. The surface was re-worked many times until a
satisfactory form was achieved. Two “Class A” automotive styling surface modelers were
contracted from the Detroit Michigan area to perform the work. These skilled surface
modelers required approximately six person months just to perform the rationalization.


The exterior concrete walls, while predominately planar, were folded back into developable
surface configurations at their top edges. This configuration allowed formwork to be
developed using plywood sheet, bent into developable surface configurations. Two strategies
for the development of this form work were used at different phases of the project. Initially,
most of the curves concrete surfaces were constructed with plywood form work, supported
by straight members that followed the lines of ruling established in the CATIA model (Figure



                                                                                              189

                         Figure VI-27 Curved surface concrete formwork
VI-27A). As the project progressed, the process was modified to construct the concrete
formwork from plywood sheathing on template cut forms (Figure VI-27B). In the case of the
concrete system, the advantage of using straight, unformed materials for the formwork
construction was apparently outweighed by the difficulty of positioning the linear members on
site   into   the   required   configurations.   The
developable surface configurations of the curved
concrete structure was still used to advantage. But
on these surfaces, developable surface condition
came to be relied on only as a guarantee that the
plywood formwork would conform to the shape.

The structural steel and metal enclosure system
had more a ambitious agenda for the use of
developable surfaces its fabrication strategy. The
lines of ruling were to be used both to gain
efficiency in the primary structure, and in the
construction of the final substrate of the finish
surface.


The primary steel structure is developed through
two quite distinct systems23. One system is
                                                         Figure VI-28: Stick and pipe structural
                                                                        system

                                                                                              190
employed where the lines or ruling course in a predominately vertical direction (Figure VI-28).
Here, the primary direction of loading is in the direction of the ruling lines. Straight steel tubes
sections between 8”x4” and 20”x12” are employed, depending on the local axial and bending
loading determined by the engineering analysis. These tubes are supported by the concrete
structure, and span between slab edges offset approximately 1’2” from the finish surface.
Where slab edges do not occur at the required support points for the primary steel, the
design of additional secondary steel assemblies were required.


The columns are connected by a series of custom curved steel pipes 4” in diameter. The
pipe system is defined by a series of horizontal planar cuts with the finish surface, again
offset inward to accommodate the dimensions of the cladding system. These cuts lines are
spaced at 4’ vertical increments, to support a finish surface capable of spanning a maximum
of 6’ along the direction of ruling. The pipe system additionally provides the lateral and
racking stability of the structure.


The fabricator proposed that the pipe system be constructed as into a series of prefabricated
frames, spanning from tube to tube. The assembly of structural tube systems and ladders
were assembled off site, in the fabricators’ shop to guarantee conformance with the digital
information in a controlled setting. These prefabricated elements were then disassembled,
shipped and re-assembled on site.


A second system was designed for conditions
where the lines of ruling coursed in an
approximately horizontal direction. Here, the
primary direction of loading is across the line
of ruling. To address the primary loading, a
curved,    Vierendeel      truss      system   was
designed. The curved trusses as constructed
from two curves, again defined as offsets of
the design surfaces. These exterior and                    Figure VI-29: Ladder truss system

interior pipes were joined by a series of plates to complete the truss assembly (Figure VI-29).
The trusses are typically spanned directly by the finish surface substrate.




                                                                                               191
Initially, it was envisioned that the interior
pipe would correspond to the geometry of the
project interior surfaces. However, this two
sided control of the truss geometry was
eventually deemed too complicated to design
while    simultaneously      addressing     the
structural requirements of the elements. In
retrospect, the interior chord of the trusses
could   have     been     more    economically     Figure VI-30: Back pan on hat channels
constructed using segmented, rather than
curved, pipes.


In the Weatherhead system, the primary
structural system is the focus of the most
intensive engineering and fabrication efforts.
This relative complexity paid off on the finish
surface, which is vastly simplified relative to
                                                     Figure VI-31: Finish surface layers
previous projects.      The finish system is
comprised of a series of hat channels, which
attach directly to the curved pipes of the
primary steel system. These hat channels
are positioned on site along the lines of ruling
established in the CATIA model. These
panels are fixed directly onto the pipe system
with steel nails, then are simply cut to size at
the edges and seams between surface
forms. A series of overlapping galvanized
sheet metal panels complete the substrate of
the finish surface. An ice and waterproofing
membrane is attached to the galvanized back
panel. Finally, the finish shingle system is
                                                   Figure VI-32: Shingled developable form
applied on site, attached to clips that are




                                                                                             192
screwed through the self healing waterproofing membrane. The shingles are designed with a
small metal gutter channel, to further assist in diverting water to the outside of the system.
Insulation is provided on the interior side of the hat channels.


In cases where the finish surface slopes less than 25%, the cladding system is modified
slightly to become a roofing system. Stainless steel sheet is used in place of the galvanized
back panel to avoid corrosion. The stainless steel sheets welded together to            form a
continuous water barrier. The shingle clips are tack welded directly to this surface.


The question of system tolerances was a major concern during the development of these
systems. As is many times the case on Gehry’s projects, no exact precedent for any of these
systems existed on prior projects by either the firm or any of the partnering construction
organizations. The strategies of using the primary structural system as the dimensional
control, and performing the rest of the fabrication on site, presented many opportunities for
loss of dimensional control through deviation from the CATIA geometry. Additionally, the
dimensional tolerances of the finish cladding system were not fully understood at the time,
but were presumed to be quite stringent. One concern was that the attachment of the hat
channels would be compromised if successive pipes did not result in perfectly straight lines
of ruling. A second concern was that either the back panel system or the shingle system
would fail, resulting in water leakage. An additional concern was that deviation of the pipe
system from the nominal locations established in the CATIA model would read through to the
finish as the surface substrate was forced over the pipes. To address these concerns, the
specification for the pipe system required that these elements be no more than 1/16” from
the CATIA geometry at any point.


None of these failure conditions have occurred in the construction. The surface assembly
exhibited enough flexibility of all components to accommodate the construction variations
from designed conditions. In retrospect, even the driving system requirement of purely
developable surfaces has proven to be an unnecessarily stringent requirement. The
Weatherhead system could be more appropriately represented as a ruled surface, with some
as yet not established gaussian curvature limitations. This would have provided additional
flexibility of the surface form to both the project designers and the CATIA modeling team.
However, it must be recognized that the initial design development decision to rationalize the
form into purely developable surfaces has resulted in a system with virtually no problems


                                                                                          193
during construction. This stringent requirement on the surfaces has translated into some
space to maneuver in the field.


Experiences on the Weatherhead project show the substantial opportunities for construction
efficiencies offered by developable surfaces. The presence of lines of ruling in the geometry
of developable surfaces is a major, somewhat serendipitous benefit of this representation of
paper surfaces. Additionally, the presence of an invariant surface normal facilitates
connections to framing members without angular variation in the connection detail. The
benefit of having at least one sub-system of the cladding strategy comprised of straight stick
elements is obvious.


There is, however, one major and non-intuitive draw back to the construction of developable
surface forms. The “flow” of the ruling lines on a developable surface is highly – and non-
intuitively – governed by subtle variations the surface quality. Supporting structural systems
are compelled to follow the spatial layouts of these ruling lines. This can result in a structural
organization with many special conditions for supports and column locations. This rather
complex organization stands in contrast to the relatively simple structural organizations of
planar cut ribs in curvature constrained panel systems. While the efficiency of constructing
curved surface forms from straight linear elements presents a potential cost efficiency over
planar rib constructions, this efficiency can be offset by the lack of control in the locations of
these members.

C.       SUMMARY OF EXISTING PAPER SURFACE REPRESENTATIONS
In the historical progression of Gehry’s body of work, it is possible to trace the progressive
development of paper surface geometries and their associated techniques of description and
modeling. This progression shows a continuing expansion of the class of admissible paper
surface forms, as improved representation and fabrication techniques permit less
constrained geometries to be feasibly supported in the building process. The planar forms of
Gehry’s early work, described in Section IV.A, represent the point of departure of this
progression.


Cylindrical and conic forms begin to appear on relatively early projects, including the Winston
Guest House, Edgemar Development, and the Chiat Day Building. These forms appear
tentatively, sparing applied in an overall composition of planar forms. Prior to the introduction
of computer modeling techniques in the firm’s process, paper surfaces take Euclidean forms,
true cones and cylinders. Their more general counterparts were formulated as developable
surfaces in Section VI.B. This constraint is imposed on these early projects by limitations of
traditional documentation. The complexity of determining geometric relationships between
more complex, non-Euclidean conic forms was simply beyond the capabilities of traditional
architectural delineation.


The exploration of a vocabulary of conic forms continues to be expanded on Gehry’s projects
until the introduction of computer modeling in 1990. The Weissman Museum (Figure VI-33)
represents the culmination of this approach. Each face of the west façade is delineated
through traditional geometric constructions. The difficulty of performing this construction
though    traditional   architectural   delineation   is   clearly   evident   in   the   construction
documentation.

The early computer models of the Disney Concert Hall (Figure VI-34) document the
extension of the firm’s manual approach to developing complex geometries through a
vocabulary of Euclidean surface elements. In the initial design of the DCH project, prior to
1998, the project was intended to be clad in CNC milled stone panels. The project geometry
attempted to achieve some of the economic benefits of mass production by the use of the
quadratic surfaces. Economic constraints on the project dictated that certain economies of
scale were necessary. The design team responded to these constraints by developing cost
projections for different complexities of surface qualities. Planar surfaces were naturally
assumed to be of lower cost than curved areas. In curved surface areas, distinctions were
made between the relatively simple geometries of conic forms and fully free form areas. It
was determined that economies of scale could be taken advantage of on conic surfaces, due
to the regularity of panel elements across the latitude of a section through the conic form. A
budget limiting percentages of the project’s surface area in these categories was developed
prior to finalization of the concert hall’s shape.


It is worth noting that the initial design development on this project was conducted in 1992,
when numerically controlled milling technologies were available, but computing performance
and information distribution mechanisms were at an earlier stage of development than today.
Today, with improved efficiency of computational methods, the cost implications of CNC
cutting are more directly tied to the machining time, and less to the computation and operator
time necessary for generating the CNC tool paths for the cutting operations. Thus economic
efficiencies of batch production of similar pieces, which must still be individually processed



                                                                                                  197
by the CNC milling equipment, seem to be less significant than they must have seemed in
1989.


The project design was re-visited in 1998, when the decision was made to change the finish
material from milled stone panels to stainless steel. The conic surfaces were re-interpreted
as developable surfaces, involving a different strategy for the direction of sub-framing, but
without altering the shapes of the surfaces. Significantly the same project forms admit two
radically different approaches to efficiency of construction, one based on regularities of
element shapes, the second on ruling lines and the unfolding of panel geometry.


The Guggenheim Bilbao project, represents a
dramatic extension of the firm’s approach to
the representation of paper surface forms.
While stone was initially selected for DCH, the
surface of Bilbao is comprised of sheet metal
surfaces. Thus economic constraints were
presented to the design team in terms of
limiting the surface forms to those that could
be assumed by sheet materials. The physical
design models on Bilbao were generated by              Figure VI-35: Gaussian Curvature
                                                          mapping on Bilbao Project
folding large paper elements (relative to the
overall scale of the project) into form. The
strategy presumed that shapes which were constructed of large paper surfaces in the scale
physical models could be fabricated from individual sheet materials in actual construction.
During initial computer modeling exercises, the digitized data from the physical models were
re-interpreted using developable surfaces. These initial results did not entirely satisfy the
design team. The forms generated by developable surfaces were deemed too constrained
relative to the initial physical design models.   Additional CAD modeling operations were
performed on the initial developable surfaces, where the surfaces were “puffed out” –
deformed such that limited double curvature was introduced into the shapes. Heuristics were
determined dictating the degree to which double curvature would be introduced into the
surfaces. The utility of these heuristics was limited at the time. The fabricator determined
that the surfaces up to a sixty foot sphere could be fabricated. CATIA allowed the curvature




                                                                                          198
at individual points on the surface to be sampled. The principal radii at these sampled points
was limited to a minimum of sixty feet in either of the two principal directions.


The geometric qualities of the EMP project represent in some sense a culmination of the
firm’s paper surface modeling research and design explorations. On this project, the fully
curved free form shapes of the original design were supported as a composition of gaussian
curvature constrained paper surface forms. Admittedly, this support of fully free form shapes
is approximate, as the forms are rationalized into shapes exhibiting curvature acceptable
given constructibility constraints. These rationalization operations can be read in the final
project (Figure VI-36).


In the period since the completion of EMP, developable surface and constrained gaussian
curvature applications have developed in parallel. Although the gaussian curvature approach
presents more generous constraints on project form, the economic efficiencies of straight
lines of ruling presented by the developable surface approach are considerable. The tough
constraints of developable surfaces on project forms seem to project the energy of the sheet
material surfaces as they are formed in space better than the more relaxed qualities of the
gaussian curvature approach. The Weatherhead project represents perhaps the most
ambitious application of developable surface forms to date.


The two paper surface representations present remarkably different strategies for the
representation of similar shapes.      These differences are manifested in the substantially
different approaches to construction suggested by each representation. However, both
strategies require tight tolerances on the framing system required to achieve a form that will
match the predicted shape. If the geometry of the framing system does not adequately
provide a shape onto which sheet materials will form, then either substantial forming of the
cladding material will need to be undertaken, or warping of the surface will occur. Failures of
cladding or substrate materials may occur, or waterproofing requirements for the system may
not be achieved, resulting in a roof or wall system that leaks. Certainly, the desired
architectural quality of the surface will not be achieved, as the cladding buckles and ripples
about fasteners and joints. For simple, canonical classes of paper surfaces such as planar,
cylindrical or conical forms, the predictive capabilities required to assure developability of the
surface are not particularly great. However, to achieve the freely flowing shapes allowed by
the most general classes of paper surfaces, the predictive capabilities required to engineer


                                                                                              199
and fabricate cladding system elements while maintaining the accuracy required for system
integrity are substantial.

The geometric constraints presented by the two approaches are sufficient to guarantee
conformance of the system geometries with the behavior of sheet materials. However, these
constraints come at a price. The control structures supported by the associated CAD
techniques do not intuitively guide the user to feasible sheet material shapes. The NURBS
surface representations – manipulated by control points – tend to produce shapes with
localized variations in smoothness – exactly the opposite of the desired result. Similarly,
manipulation of the edge curves that are used to generate developable surfaces will
generally result in surfaces with triangle discontinuities. The actual operator activities
required to produce paper surface forms using either of these techniques are not directly
discernable from the input controls, and require substantial manipulation by experienced
users to “tease out” surface imperfections.


Both techniques are developed as constraints on NURBS based parametric surface
representations. The shapes produced by these techniques are largely irrespective of actual
qualities of the materials used. For gaussian curvature controls, a wide range of material and
fabrication phenomena are subsumed into a simple, and rather impoverished, metric. The
developable surface technique predicts identical surface constraints irrespective of the actual
materials employed.




                                                                                           200
If the geometric properties of NURBS based surfaces are under constrained for paper
surface applications, then the properties of developable surface based representations and
systems fall at the other extreme. Developable surface representations are highly
constrained, often resulting failing to produce feasible configurations for digitized data from
physical paper models. The constraints of zero gaussian curvature and purely linear
directrices of developable surfaces are quite rigid constraints, which render these systems to
be somewhat incompatible with the characteristics and digitized features from the more
“lenient” paper prototypes.


On the other hand, the topological characteristics of parametric surface representations are
well suited to paper surfaces. The notion of a Euclidean, parametric space that is
topologically “sheet like” – and the extension of this representation to assemblies that are
combinatorially constructed from topological sheets - maps well to the qualities of paper and
other sheet like materials, and their organization in assemblies.

VII.    PHYSICAL MODELING


A.     INTRODUCTION
The approaches to digital modeling of paper surfaces described in the previous chapter have
substantial limitations relative to the qualities of such simple modeling tools as physical paper
materials. The common characteristics of both approaches – reliance on differential
geometry heuristics and constructs – have limited capabilities for representing the behavior
of physical materials and operations. The pursuit of digital representation techniques that
provide a closer affinity to the materials and operations of physical modeling and full scale
fabrication remains an active area of research by the firm’s computing staff. This section
presents research that more directly pursues representation of the properties of the sheet
materials themselves: their qualities and modes of deformation, physical properties such as
ability to stretch and bend, their response to forces, etc. A radically different alternative to the
simulation of paper surfaces will be presented, one that relies on direct simulation of material
properties and behaviors.


Materials simulation is far from a new topic. Vast research by the engineering community has
been directed toward the representation of structural and mechanical behaviors of physical
bodies. The materials and bodies pursued through these disciplines are as large as the class
of all materials and forms of use in engineering applications. The representation of paper
surface forms through physical simulation positions this work within this body of research.


Efforts to adopt a physical simulation approach to the modeling of paper surface forms are
complicated by the broad scope and ambiguities inherent to this problem, presented in
Section IV.C. In this effort, we seek to capture those formal and operational qualities that are
common among a wide scope of building design and construction activities, from schematic
design explorations in scale using physical modeling materials, through to the actual
operations of fabricating craftsmen in the shop or field. The accuracy of representing any of
these specific processes through a common representational strategy is likely to be
qualitative at best. On the other hand, the analysis of the firm’s existing techniques presented
in Chapter VI disclosed similar limitations. Despite these limitations, the existing approaches
have been able to successfully integrate representation of project formal qualities with
fabrication constraints. We should expect a physical modeling approach to the representation


                                                                                               203
of paper surface forms to provide at least some improvement in serving the common ground
between these disparate representational requirements.


The general class of problems concerning the motion and deformation of objects are
encompassed by kinematics. Within kinematics, applications where the concern is to
determine the ultimate rest state resulting from force effects on bodies are generally
approached as statics problems, while solutions where the response of the object to these
effects over time are considered through dynamics. While it may appear that the deformation
of paper surfaces is appropriate for solution through statics, it will turn out that elements of
the dynamic behavior of the sheets as they are deformed over time will be worthy of
consideration as well.


One broad class of analysis potentially applicable to paper surface modeling is the theory of
elasticity, wherein the geometric form of the sheet results from an initially un-deformed body
– with certain parameterizable material properties – whose shape results as a response to
externally applied forces by deformation of the body. Solution of such problems take the form
of well known relationships between body stress (internal forces incurred by the body,
usually as a result of externally applied forces) and the deformation or strain of the body.
Solutions are developed through an analysis of infinitesimal elements of the body and the
characteristics of these elements in response to stress forces of the loading scenario under
consideration. The overall behavior of the body is solved by integrating the element level
response over the totality of the body.


Until the advent of computer modeling, problems in these domains were largely limited to the
inquiry of certain canonical shapes (e.g. square plates, cylindrical shells, etc.) for which the
integration could be solved in closed form. The advent of high performance computing has
allowed for element level analysis to be extrapolated to the global deformation of the shape
by considering each element’s behavior independently within the context of the assembly
solution. These approaches consider elements, not of infinitesimal character, but rather as
elements of small but finite size. The body is discretized into assemblies of elements whose
individual shapes permit an explicit solution for deformation due to externally applied forces.
Conditions of continuity and compatibility between adjoining elements are imposed, and the
global behavior of the body is determined by considering the inter-related behavior of the
individual elements.


                                                                                            204
One broad distinction that is made in terms of solution techniques for elastic problems is the
question of linearity of the problem and its solution. Elasticity problems may introduce
linearity or non-linearity in two ways: material linearity, and deformation linearity. The general
stress – strain relationship defined by Hooke’s law:


f = kd                                                                                     (VII.1)


implies a linear relationship between stress and strain. Many materials exhibit effectively
linear stress-strain relationships for small scale deformations, but this simple relationship
becomes more complex as larger scale deformations introduce more complex responses.


Similarly, many solution techniques employ linearized approximations of geometric equations
in their solutions, including small angle approximations, where trigonometric functions are
approximated into simpler forms which hold approximately for small angles. For structural
analysis problems, where one may reasonably anticipate the deformation of a building
component will be small relative to its overall dimensions, linearized approximations of the
geometry of motion are completely appropriate.


In considering sheet material solutions of the types appropriate for modeling paper surfaces,
clearly the linear geometric approximations will be inappropriate, as the anticipated
deformation of the body will be quite large. However, the notion of linear approximation of
material properties seems to be plausible, at least at a qualitative level appropriate for
schematic design requirements. One problem characteristic that will indicate whether the
sheet material responds in a linear fashion would be whether plastic deformation occurs in
the material; that is to say, given input forces that deform the material, would the material
return to its original flattened shape if these forces were removed? In the simulation of paper
surfaces, the answer to this question would be: partly. Certainly the shapes under
consideration do not develop the large scale, ductile deformation associated with stretch
forming of material. However, typically some residual deformation of the sheet will remain in
sheet metal or plywood that has been substantially curved.


Analysis of sheet like bodies has taken a wide variety of forms, again dependent on the
characteristics of the body and results to be solved for. These techniques have been
developed for analysis of structural assemblies including concrete shells, and shear walls or


                                                                                              205
other structural elements whose behavior is principally two dimensional. These approaches
have been incorporated into a wide variety of commercially available structural finite element
solver programs. Most of the theory and application regarding the behavior of plates, shells,
and membranes under loading presumes small deformation appropriate for structural bodies
that are quite rigid, and are expected to experience small scale deformation relative to their
overall dimensions. Again, most of the commercial applications for building structural
engineering are concerned with the static behavior of these elements, although modal
analyses – an essentially static solution that supports the analysis of the system’s oscillatory
behavior – are also supported. These techniques can provide highly accurate, detailed
analysis of structural elements in reasonable solution times.


The theory and applications for the solution of fully deformable material bodies, including
non-linear inelastic behavior, is also quite mature. Techniques and commercial applications
in this category are varied, including solvers appropriate for the analysis of large scale plastic
deformation and even catastrophic events such as explosions. These applications may utilize
highly non-linear representations of strain behavior. Solution techniques may use non-linear
representations of geometric deformation, or may discretize the behavior of the system into
small, incremental motions over time. A potentially serious limitation of many of these
approaches is the time to solution. Robust techniques may require the solution of coupled
partial differential equations for the various modes of motion, and will require the iterative
solution of these equations over many time steps in order to perform the simulation.


As a generalization of physical modeling problems, differing representations of the problem
domain – involving differing approximations of the body’s shape and behavior – can produce
dramatically different accuracy of prediction, with related differences in computational
expense. This relationship between the accuracy of representation of a bodies behavior and
the computational expense to achieve the solution should be not surprising.


This question of desired accuracy of solution in the simulation of paper surfaces is an
important one. In principle, the problem domain could be tackled as one of extraordinary
complexity, involving plastic deformation of the sheet material under loading, friction
resistances between sheets at their joints, and accurate solutions for fastener’s structural
behavior. However, it is not clear whether this high level of complexity of solution technique




                                                                                              206
would provide results that would merit the substantial penalties in terms of computational
expense.


In developing a materials modeling based approach to paper surfaces for design
applications, a primary consideration is to achieve tools whose speed of solution is sufficient
for designers and drafters to model shapes interactively. A solution technique that accurately
produces the most subtle details of behavior will not be useful if modification of surfaces to
reflect changes in design requires hours of off-line computation. At a global level – where
large scale surface shapes are under consideration, a solution technique that can
qualitatively direct the shape to a feasible form may be sufficient, if interactive speeds can be
achieved. At the level of verifying a specific sheet’s shape to determine appropriate
placement of framing members, solution techniques with potentially higher accuracy may be
required.


The solution methods employed by the engineering communities have generally favored
detailed computational models of physical behavior, resulting in highly accurate solutions, at
the expense of potentially long solution times. This predilection is easy to understand in
engineering applications where life and equipment safety are issues.


At perhaps the opposite end of the spectrum, new physical modeling approaches are
appearing in computer animation applications. Substantial work has been undertaken in the
simulation of deformable objects in general, and in the simulation of deformable surfaces in
particular. These physical modeling applications provide reasonable, qualitative behavior of
physical bodies for the purposes of computer animation. These approaches are generally
concerned with the time variant behavior of the systems, with time varying effects such as
collisions between objects, temporally modified constraints on the objects (e.g. the motion of
a human character supporting a cloth object). Simulation for the purposes of computer
animation has the demand of achieving a visual realism that produces a perceptual accuracy
of physical behavior with substantial degrees of detail, but performs a certain trade off
between accuracy of the simulation and computational speed. These simulations are
typically rendered off line, so interactive speeds are not a requirement. The strongest
demand on such simulations is the degree of detail required.




                                                                                             207
Great attention by the computer graphics community has been focused on the simulation of
cloth, for the purpose of clothing characters in animations. Notable work in this domain has
been research by Feynman26, Terzopoulus89, Provot71, Baraff and Witkin5, and many others.

authors.



B.     DEFORMABLE BODY MOTION
This section outlines the basic framework of material body deformation, appropriate for
application to paper surface simulation. The discussion follows closely the derivations of
classical texts on the theory of elasticity, including Marsden and Hughes53. We will be
considering the motion of a material body, and the relative motion of parts of this body, in
response to external effects (typically represented as forces), over the progression of time. It
is useful when considering this transformation of the body over time, to focus on a primary,
invariant reference configuration B as the original, un-deformed state relative to which all
future deformed configurations of the body will be considered. We consider the reference
configuration B to have a coordinate system and “space” independent of the world space R3.
This will allow variations in positions to be viewed from the perspective of the body,
irrespective of deformation or positioning in space. It will be convenient when considering
rates of deformation of the body appropriate for calculation of stresses experienced by the
body to have this invariant coordinate system available to which changes in the body
configuration may be compared.




                                                                                            208
When considering solid bodies, this body
coordinate system will be of course 3-
dimensional. For other types of objects,
including the 2-D surface objects that will be
used to represent paper surfaces, it will not be
necessary to maintain an independent out-of
plane axis for the body space, and in fact a
two   dimensional        coordinate     system   and
associated       space     will    be     preferable.
Coordinates of the body in the 2D reference

space will be denoted u ∈ B, and are termed
material       points,     while      corresponding
coordinates in world space will be denoted x = (x1, x2, x3) ∈ R3, and are termed spatial
points. A configuration of B is a mapping φ: B → R3, which maps points in body space to
locations in the world coordinate system. Over the course of time, the body will undergo
motion, represented as a sequenced family of configurations: the deformed shapes of the
body over time. The notion of the mapping function φ will thus be embellished to incorporate
the notion that the function maps material points to spatial points, not simply as a function of
the point’s body space coordinates, but also as a function of a time parameter t. This function
is notated:
x = φ (u, t)                                                                                   (VII.2)


The function φ may now be seen as an “engine” which takes in material point locations and
as well as “points in time”, and delivers locations in R3 space. Since the values returned by φ
are actually a 3-tuple x = (x1, x 2, x 3), we can consider the function φ as being comprised of
three component functions, φ = (φ1, φ2, φ3 ), each of which take the input variables u = (u1,
u2) = (u, v) and t, and return one of the spatial coordinates


Note that the formulation of this material deformation problem is quite similar to the
parametric surface representations explored in Part 2. We have simply introduced an extra
dimension, time, to input of the manifold representation of surfaces x = σ (u) (V.29). In the
same manner that we fix the parameter u2 in (V.29), setting it equal to some constant c, and
view the result as a curve in space x = σ (u1, c ) , we can freeze the variable t in (VII.2) and


                                                                                                  209
view the result as a simply as a surface in R3. Alternatively, we can fix the parameters u1 and
u2 and view the function x = φ ((c1, c2), t) as a function that defines the path in space of a
single parametric point (c1, c2) over time. This similarity between parametric surface and
deformable body representations is far from coincident. Both are subsumed within the
general construct of manifolds, presented in Section V.C. From a manifold perspective, there
is no distinction between the time parameter t and the spatial parameters u1 or u2. The
deformable body representation simply changes the degree of the problem from the form R2
→ R3 to the form R3 → R3. The distinction between time and space parameters is found only
in the internal definition of the function φ, i.e. what φ “does with” the parameters, not any
special properties of the parameters themselves.


The notion of a global function representing the full history of a complicated shaped object
and its state at all points over time may seem like an overwhelming construct to readers rusty
in calculus. Indeed, this function is not one that can in general be described explicitly, except
for fairly simple objects following fairly simple paths. In subsequent sections, when specific
solution techniques are discussed, the presence of such a global function will be presumed
as an organizing structure, but will never be directly solved for. Rather, we will determine
localized characteristics of this function on the basis of the state of the body, and pursue
numerical solutions designed to locally trace the path of the body in space and time along
this function.


With the notion of the mapping function φ established, rates of change in the shape or
location of the body may be determined by taking derivatives of the function with respect to
either material coordinates or time. By holding the material coordinates u constant in the
function x = φ(u, t), we achieve a function representing the path of a point on the body
through space as time is varied. Taking the derivative of φ with respect to t will produce a
function representing the velocity of points of the body, represented as a 3-dimensional
space vector for each point xi ∈ B. This vector will be located in R3, pointing in the direction
of the path in space of the point, with a length equal to the speed of the point. The
components of this space vector will be the derivatives of the components functions, dφ/dt.
The acceleration of the body, unsurprisingly, takes the form of the second derivative of φ with
respect to time, i.e. d2φ /dt2.




                                                                                             210
Similarly, we can hold t fixed in the function φ(u, t), and consider the shape of the body
relative to that of the reference configuration by taking derivatives of φ with respect to u. The
partial derivatives of φi with respect to the material coordinates uj form a matrix Fij = dφi/duj,
called the deformation gradient. This matrix of derivatives embodies both a rotational
component, forming the transformation of the material coordinates of the body into the spatial
coordinates due to rigid rotation of the body, and a component representing the deformation
of the body due to stretch or compression. The deformation gradient may be decomposed
as:


F = RU


Where R is the rotation matrix and U is the right stretch tensor. The strain deformation of the
body at a point may be determined directly from the stretch tensor, by determining the eigen
values of this matrix. Higher degree derivatives of the mapping function φ with respect to u
may of course be found.


For the general cases of arbitrary paper shapes and input constraints, representing the
function φ explicitly is not possible, so we can not solve this equation directly. However, we
can determine, for a given configuration of the body x at a time t, features of the function φ
that will allow us to understand the impending rates of change in x as a function of t.
Specifically, we can determine the strain function of φ by comparing the shape of x to that of
the reference configuration u. We will then be able to work backwards to produce an
understanding of the shape of the function φ in the “direction” of the parameter t. In order to
attain this solution, we discretize the complex continuum of both the reference configuration
B and the time domain t into an assembly of discrete, inter-related intervals. Discretization
transforms the partial differential equation of motion into a system of linked ordinary
differential equations, allowing the solution for each element of the body to be considered
initially independently. This localized consideration of the problem can be adopted to produce
approximations of the rates of change of φ at discrete points in time. These localized states
of the problem (in space and time) can be integrated numerically by stepping through time,
determining the current configuration of the body, determining the localized shape of the
function φ from its approximated derivatives, and projecting the state of the simulation
forward for some interval of time. The state of the body at this new point in time is then



                                                                                              211
checked relative to the reference configuration, and the process is repeated until the
converged state of the body has been detected.


With the inclusion of a damping effect, which generates a incremental resistance to the
direction of motion, we can anticipate that – presuming no influxes of energy into the system
are introduced - the body will ultimately wind up converging to a rest state and deformation at
some point in time. To paraphrase, for some value trest the magnitude of the velocity vector
v(u, trest) will be within some neighborhood of 0 for all B. At that point, the desired shape and
location of the body, representing the body’s response to all applied external forces, will have
been determined. The theoretical goal of the simulation is to determine the shape of the
deformed body xrest = φ(u, trest) at this future time of convergence.



C.       A SIMPLE EXAMPLE
As   a    point   of   departure,    a    simple
representation of physical sheet materials is
presented in this section. This simple model
will be extended to a more robust formulation
in subsequent sections of this chapter. The
approach discussed in this section is derived
from that proposed by Provot71 and others. It
draws on a simplified, linear representation of
the localized differential equations of motion.
The mathematics employed in solving these
differential equations is at the level of high          Figure VII-2: A simple mass-spring model of
school physics, where acceleration, velocity                           sheet materials

and location are related through straight
forward multiplications of the derivatives with time.


The surface is represented as an initially flat array of points organized in a grid. The material
properties of the surface (mass, stiffness, etc.) are abstracted as a set of mass points at the
nodes of the grid, and springs which join these nodes. The mass of a square of material is
allocated to the node at its center. Springs join an individual node to its neighbors. The




                                                                                                 212
relative location between two joined nodes determines the kind of stress to which the given
spring responds .


1. Springs which join a node to its nearest horizontal / vertical neighbors govern the
    behavior of the node when subjected to internal axial forces.
2. Springs that join a node to its diagonal neighbors govern internal shear force response.
3. Springs which join a node to the horizontal / vertical neighbors located two units away
    govern the flexural behavior of the intermediate node.

demonstration of the spring behavior. Each

a particle p0 due to a spring of rest length l

                          l      p1 − p0                                      spring assembly


           p1 − p0
where              is simply a unit vector in the direction p0→p1, and Kspring is a constant that
           p1 − p0

dictates the stiffness or force associated with the spring. Differing stiffness constants may be
allocated to the spring types (1 - 3). Variations in these relative spring constants affect the
qualitative behavior of the surface material. Approximate values for these spring constants
could be determined from the material properties of the material, thickness of the material
and distance between the nodes.


In addition to the internal forces of the material stiffness, the surface may be subjected to
external forces, including:
•   gravity

                                                                                                             213
•   positioning during fabrication
•   framing and fastening constraints.


These external actions on the surface can be formulated in a variety of ways, depending on
the type of behavior of interest. The actions manifest themselves as force vectors – possibly
varying over time – acting on the mass nodes. As a simple example, the action of gravity is
formulated as the vector:
            0 
                 
fgravity =  0                                                                           (VII.4)
            -mag 
                 


where ag is the acceleration of gravity and m the mass of the node. This force is applied
constantly on each node in the surface representation.


An additional damping force is added to each node, based on the velocity of the node at a
give point in time:
fdamp = −K damp v 0                                                                       (VII.5)


The damping component tacked on to each particle as a function of its velocity, ensures that
a rest state will ultimately occur. If this damping factor were not figured in, the surface could
oscillate indefinitely.


To solve for the deformed surface under loading, all of the force vectors acting on an
individual node at a particular point in time t0 are summed, producing a force vector f acting
on the node. The surface state is then considered at an incremental time step t0 + h. The
algorithm uses a simple linear method for approximating the changes in surface state over
this time step:


We consider the system for a specific time step (t0, t0 + h), with a known position of all
particles x0 and known velocity v = x& , the system is solved for a new position vector x0+h,
and a new velocity vector v0+h. The differential equations representing the system are:
d x d x           v         
    &  =   =  −1                                                                    (VII.6)
dt  x  dt  v   M f ( x, v ) 



                                                                                             214
Discretizing the equations, we define
∆v = v(t0 + h) - v(t0 )
                                                                                         (VII.7)
∆x = x(t0 + h) - x(t0 )


The solution to the differential equation in (VII.6) approximates ∆x and ∆v as
 ∆x    v0 
  = h  −1                                                                            (VII.8)
 ∆v    M f0 
These equations are simply:
         f ( x, v )
∆v = h                                                                                   (VII.9)
             m
∆x = v = v0 + h∆v                                                                       (VII.10)

x = x 0 + h ∆x                                                                          (VII.11)


In this simple formulation, these three equations may be solved independently (for each
particle) and sequentially, once the force vector f(x,v) has been determined. First, ∆v is
solved for by multiplying the time step size by force, and dividing by the mass of the particle.
Adding the change in velocity ∆v to the previous velocity produces the new particle velocity.
The change in location ∆x is similarly solved for (VII.10), by multiplying the new velocity by
the time step. The change in particle location is added to the current location to produce the
particle location at the end of the time step.


Note that a particle’s location and velocity are each represented by three values,
representing respectively, the location and velocity’s 3 spatial components. A total of 6
values must be stored for each particle during the simulation. Each component is
approximated as a linear function over the time step, and represents an independent function
that may be independently solved for.


The acceleration of the node is equal to the force on the node divided by the node’s mass:
a(t0) = f(t0 ) / m                                                                      (VII.12)


The velocity of the node is equal to the old velocity plus the new acceleration multiplied by
the time step.



                                                                                            215
v(t0) = v(t0 ) + h a(t0)                                                                      (VII.13)


The new node location is equal to the old location plus the new velocity multiplied by the time
step.
x(t0 + h) = x(t0 ) + h v(t0)                                                                  (VII.14)


As a result of solving these three equations,
we have new node locations, velocities and
accelerations. On the basis of the new point
locations and their distances from each
other, the new spring forces can be
computed. Viewed in its entirety, the
simulation presents the object shape and
path in space over the lifetime of the
simulation. The algorithm is repeated until
point locations stabilize, and the velocity of
each point falls below a specified minimum
value.


The approach taken offers compelling initial
results for modeling sheet based materials
with a range of material properties (Figure
VII-4).    Despite the visually compelling
results produced by this formalization, there
are     some    critical   limitations   of   the
approach. The current material model only
qualitatively represents the physical forces
in the material. It is unlikely that the spring
constants and their organization in this
formulation would be sufficient to predict
                                                    Figure VII-4:Results of materials simulation based
true materials’ behavior accurately enough                       on a simple spring model

                                                                                                  216
The flexure formulation is particularly weak. The representation of bending force is related to
changes in the distance between alternating nodes. This approximation makes the
assumption that the material stiffness due to stretching and shearing is high enough relative
to the bending stiffness that changes in the distances between directly neighboring nodes is
negligible. While this is typically true for thin, flexible materials, many potential materials such
as cloth will allow non-trivial axial deformation. This deformation will impact the forces
derived due to bending. Additionally, the concept of using spring length as a parameter
results in a bending force that varies with the small angle approximation for the cosine of the
bending. Bending forces will not begin to kick in until the angle is large, and variations in the
angle at small angles will produce little change in the bending force. A preferred formulation
of the bending force would be related to the sine of the angle for small angles, where small
variations in the angle from flat would produce proportional changes in opposing force.
However, modifications to the representations of forces on the system – in particular stress
strain relationships within the simulation could be augmented to improve the accuracy of this
representation (albeit with potentially substantial computation costs).


There is a more critical limitation of the above approach to solving the differential equations
of motion, in terms of the stability of the solution. This is a well known limitation of the forward
Euler method solution (VII.8) to the differential equation of motion. The above described
method limits it understanding of the path of a particle in space by considering only velocity -
the first derivative of the particles’ location. The form of the solution – and that of the paths
taken by the particles – is linear. At each step in the simulation, the trajectory of each particle
is determined; the particle is then sent down this trajectory in a straight line for the period
determined by the time step h. For small time steps this approach closely approximates the
“true” motion of the original, pre-discretized body B. As the time step is increased, the
collective locations of particles at a given time map less and less well to this true shape. At
each time step the spring forces attempt to draw the discretized body back to the true shape
of the deformed body. For time steps greater than a certain duration, the discrepancy is large
enough that the spring forces will actually force the particles to diverge, as each step causes
the particles to overshoot their correct locations by greater and greater distances. At that
point, the simulation will be considered to have achieved instability, and the surface form in
the simulation will appear to have exploded.




                                                                                               217
The time step size required for instability to occur depends on a number of factors4, including
the number of particles in the simulation, the proportion between time step and spring
constants, and the variation in spring constants in the simulation. The time step decreases at
least as a factor of the number of particles n. Since the number of computations during an
iteration is again proportional to n, the growth in time required for solution is at least n2. This
drastically limits the number of particles, and the level of detail, that can be supported by this
simple numerical solution. If the time step exceeds a value roughly constrained by the speed
at which forces propagate through the spring matrix, the solution becomes unstable. The
prototype of the application described above (written in AutoCAD r14 C++) takes
approximately 5 minutes to converge for a 30 x 30 node mesh – obviously too slow for
interactive applications.



D.       IMPLICIT INTEGRATION APPROACH
A more robust alternative is to adopt a solution method that takes into account higher
derivatives of the differential equations of motion x = φ(u, t). This section takes an approach
closely related to that proposed by Baraf and Witken5 for the simulation of cloth materials –
one directly applicable to the simulation of paper surfaces as well.


In order to address the instability issues of the example, a formulation of the motions of mass
particles is adopted that is quadratic in time, as opposed to the linear example above. We will
thus be drawing on higher, second order derivatives of the equations of motion. The inclusion
of these higher order derivatives in the linked solution of the particle assembly introduces
additional computational requirements. The Taylor series expansion for the integration of the
position vector x at time t1 = t0 + h is:
                                    h2           h3           h n ∂x n
x(t0 + h ) = x(t0 ) + hx& (t0 ) +      &&(t0 ) +
                                       x            &&(t0 ) +
                                                    x                  + ...               (VII.15)
                                    2!           3!           n ! ∂t n


In the example above, the solution technique approximates this function only to the first
derivative, resulting in O(h2) error:
x(t0 + h ) = x(t0 ) + hx& (t0 ) + O(h 2 )                                                  (VII.16)


The current approach will introduce an additional, second order term:




                                                                                              218
                                    h2
x(t0 + h ) = x(t0 ) + hx& (t0 ) +      &&(t0 ) + O(h 3 )
                                       x                                                       (VII.17)
                                    2!


The solution technique is generally concerned with solving the ordinary differential equation:
              ∂E
&& = M−1( −
x                + f)                                                                          (VII.18)
              ∂x


where E is a scalar energy function representing the internal state of the material, while f is a
function of x representing external forces acting on the body. The vector x is the geometric
state of the material – an ordered 3n vector composed of the x,y, and z coordinates of the
spatial points of the material. The matrix M represents the mass distribution of the body over
the spatial points.


The first step in this solution is to formulate the internal and external forces such that the first
and second derivative terms in (VII.17) may be computed. The solution technique begins by
introducing a behavior function, which models the various phenomena in the simulation as
localized equations in terms of the states of one or more of the particles. For example, the
behavior function for a spring between two particles is simply:


C(p, q) = | p - q | - l0                                                                       (VII.19)


i.e., the value is the difference of the distance between the two particles’ locations and some
ideal spring length l0. From the perspective of this single spring, the state of the particle
configuration is optimal when C(x1,x2) = 0, or the distance between the two points is equal to
the spring’s ideal length. Forces generated on particles by the behavior functions will be in
the direction of this optimal state. The force formulation is produced by first defining a scalar
energy function


      ks
E=       CC                                                                                    (VII.20)
      2


where ks is a stiffness constant. The force due to this scalar potential is the negative of the
energy gradient, so the force on a particle represented in the function C(x1, . . ., xn) is:




                                                                                                  219
         ∂E            ∂C
fi = −        = − k sC                                                                    (VII.21)
         ∂x i          ∂x i


Thus, we are able to determine on the basis of a general behavior function the direction and
magnitude of forces on the individual particles that minimize the non-optimality expressed by
the behavior functions.

E.        BACKWARDS EULER METHOD
While in the simple example described in Section VII.C is solved using only a knowledge of
the state of the system at the beginning of a time step t0, the backwards Euler solution
requires knowledge of the state of the equations of motion at the terminus of the step t =t0 +h:


 ∆x             v0 + ∆v          
  = h  −1                                                                             (VII.22)
 ∆v    M f ( x 0 + ∆x, v0 + ∆v ) 


It is in the new formulation for the force function f ( x 0 + ∆x, v 0 + ∆v ) that the higher order

terms that produce additional stability in the solution must be provided. This function is
rendered to first order approximation as:
                                 ∂f      ∂f
f ( x 0 + ∆x, v0 + ∆v ) = f0 +      ∆x +    ∆v                                            (VII.23)
                                 ∂x      ∂v
Substitution into (VII.22) yields:

             ∂f         ∂f                 ∂f
(I − hM−1       − h 2M−1 )∆v = hM−1( f0 + h v0 )                                          (VII.24)
             ∂v         ∂x                 ∂x


Left multiplying the equation by the mass matrix M results in:


          ∂f      ∂f              ∂f
(M − h       − h 2 )∆v = h( f0 + h v0 )                                                   (VII.25)
          ∂v      ∂x              ∂x


This is the equation that will be solved in matrix form to produce the values for the vector Dv.
With the values of Dv determined, solution for the updated particle locations can be
determined by “plugging in” the values for Dv in the upper part of (VII.22).




                                                                                              220
Equation (VII.25) has the following components:
     •   M, the mass matrix.
     •   The force vector f0 determined from the energy function as per (VII.21).
     •   The jf/jx term, which appears twice, once on the left side of the equation multiplied
         by h2 and Dv, and again on the right side of the equation multiplied by h and v0. This
         is the first derivative of the force function by x, i.e. the second derivative of the energy
         function. Consequently (VII.25) requires a second derivative of the behavior function
         C. Taking the derivative (VII.21) with respect to x yields:

         ∂fi          ∂C( x ) ∂C( x )T ∂ 2C ( x )        
              = −k s                  +           C( x ) 
         ∂x j         ∂x       ∂x j     ∂x i ∂x j        
                          i                              
             ∂f
     •   h      , where h is the time step and jf/jv the derivative of the force function with
             ∂v
         respect to velocity.



F.       MATERIAL FORMULATION
In this section, details of the formulation of the energy functions, corresponding to specific
modes of deformation for paper surfaces are presented. The modes of behavior of the
system that the solution will be concerned with are internal forces acting between mass
particles as a function of the deformation of the surface, and external forces such as springs,
cables, viscous damping and gravity. The internal behavior of the material are rendered into
three distinct deformation modes with corresponding force formulations:


1. Axial deformation, representing stretching or compression of the material. Of these,
     stretch will be the most common behavior, since compressive actions will typically result
     in buckling and bending of the material.


2. Shear deformation, representing in-plane skewing of the material. The treatment of this
     action will be the main characteristic distinguishing the modeling of paper surfaces from
     similar cloth simulations in the literature.


3. Bending deformation, represented as an angular deviation from flat at edges within the
     body of the material.



                                                                                                221
In constructing the formulations of the internal material forces, the deformed body principles
of Section VII.B above will be revisited. It will be also beneficial to keep in mind the
terminology and representation of parametric surfaces presented in Section V.D.

1.      Derivatives of the Mapping Function φ
Consider a set of i particles with unchanging material coordinates (ui,vi) in a 2D planar space,
and simultaneous spatial xi coordinates in R3. The function:
φ(u,v) = x                                                                              (VII.26)


maps 2D material coordinates to spatial coordinates in R3. The stretch deformation is
represented by the derivatives of this function with respect to u and v:


φu = jφ/ju                                                                              (VII.27)
φv = jφ/jv


These functions describe vectors in R3, analogous to the tangent vectors to the parametric
curves describes in Chapter V. The magnitudes of these vectors for a given point represent
the stretch (or compression) in the material directions of (u,v).


We can approximate these functions locally, by considering the deformation of a triangular
region of the material in R3, and comparing the deformed shape of the triangle relative to its
shape in parametric space. On this basis, we approximate a mapping function x= ω(u,v)
between parametric and world space that is applied over the region of an individual triangle.
We consider the triangle with labeled nodes i, j, k. and define the R3 vectors representing the
differences between the vertices’ spatial coordinates:
Dx1= xj - xi                                                                            (VII.28)
Dx2= xk - xi


And similar differences in the (u,v) planar, parametric space of the material coordinates:
Du1= uj - ui , Dv1= vj - vi                                                             (VII.29)
Du2= uk - ui , Dv2= vk - vi


Making the assumption that wu and wv are constant over the region defined by the triangle,
we may state:

                                                                                             222
Dx1= wuDu1 + wvDv1                                                                       (VII.30)
Dx2= wuDu2 + wvDv2


which in turn allows the solution for ωu and ωv, the derivates of ω with respect to u and v:
                                             −1
                               ∆u ∆u2 
     (ωu ω v ) = ( ∆x1 ∆x 2 )  1        
                               ∆v1 ∆v 2 
                          1                        ∆v 2 −∆u2 
              =                     ( ∆ x1 ∆x 2 )                                      (VII.31)
                  ∆u1∆v 2 − ∆u2 ∆v1                −∆v1 ∆u1 
                ∆x ∆v − ∆x 2 ∆v1            -∆x1∆u2 + ∆x 2 ∆u1 
              = 1 2                                            
                ∆u1∆v 2 − ∆u2 ∆v1           ∆u1∆v 2 − ∆u2 ∆v1 



2.        Stretch Formulation
With the differential functions for wu and wv defined, we defined energy functions associated
with stretch in the u and v directions as:
Cstretch_u(x) = a Kstretch_u ( |wu| - 1)                                                 (VII.32)
Cstretch_v(x) = a Kstretch_v ( |wv| - 1)


Where a is the area of the triangle (in constant, material space) and Kstretch_u, Kstretch_v are
constants indicating the relative stiffness of the material in stretch. While for many of
materials these two constants may be equal, there are many types of materials where we
may want to selectively vary the stiffness in the two directions (for example, corrugated
materials, plywood, chain link meshes, etc.)

If k ≠ l          = 0 , the derivative of ω with respect to a component of x is independent of any

3.         Shear Function Formulation
The shear energy is approximated as by the angle of deformation in the plane of the
material, for each triangle. By small angle approximation, we can presume this angle is
approximately equal to its cosine for small angle deformations, and hence is formulated as
the inner product of the variations in the derivatives of the mapping function:

Cshear ( x ) = aωu ωv

4.      Bend Function Formulation
In contrast to the stretch and shear formulations, where these functions are considered
relative to the deformation of a single triangle, the bending of a triangulated mesh will be
considered by changes in the angle between two triangles, at the adjoining edge. If we
presume that the reference configuration is initially flat, initial angle at each edge is 0 and the
energy associated with bending deformation will be proportional to the angle Q formed at the
edge:
Cbend(x) = KbendQ                                                                          (VII.38)




This angle is equivalent to the angle between the normals of the two triangles n1 and n2.
Letting e be the unit vector parallel to the edge, the trigonometric relations for the angle are:
sin(Q) = (n1 × n2) • e                                                                     (VII.39)

cos(Q) = n1 • n2

5.      Damping
The definition of an appropriate damping function is critical to the simulation. Although the
formulation represents the behavior of the paper material as a dynamic, time based
simulation, the primary concern in this application is the ultimate, static behavior of the
materials once they have “settled down” to a minimal energy configuration state, and the
velocities and accelerations of the particles have fallen to within some threshold of 0. A
“springy” system without the presence of damping will oscillate about the rest state, and
never settle down. Thus damping serves the important function of driving the simulation to
the rest state, by dissipating the kinetic energy in the system. At the same time, damping
competes with the action of forces, and their associated accelerations and velocities, in
driving the system toward the minimal energy rest state. Thus, tuning the damping to allow
efficient translation of the mass particles toward the rest state, while minimizing over-
shooting and oscillation, is an important component in efficiently moving the simulation
toward solution.


Damping serves a second important function in the stability of the simulation. By damping out
residual forces resulting from the second order approximation of the differential equations of
motion, a damping component allows larger time steps to be achieved while still allowing
stability of the simulation.


A straight forward formulation of damping effects on a particle is viscous damping, where the
force on the particle is inversely proportional to the particle’s velocity:


fdamp = - Kdamp v(x)                                                                    (VII.47)


which approximates the behavior as if it were immersed in some motion resistant medium
such as air, water, or “jelly” – depending on the value of Kdamp. Barraf and Witkin’s
                                                               ∂f
formulation draws on the second term of (VII.24), hM−1            , as the means for formulating
                                                               ∂v
damping associated with a given deformation mode. The damping acts on the component of
system velocity in the jC/jx direction, and provides damping associated with a energy
function condition C as:
                  ∂C &
fdamp = −K damp        C( x )                                                           (VII.48)
                  ∂x i


                                                                                            228
While this formulation results in more believable time based simulations of motion, it results
in additional computational overhead in computing the additional energy function derivatives.
Since our paper simulator application is concerned principally with accurately representing
the rest state of the body, this additional overhead required to provide a more realistic
simulation of the body’s behavior over time does not seem necessary, and the more straight
forward viscous damping formulation has been used in the simulator.



6.       Springs
In the paper modeler, a spring is typically an object – and associated energy condition - that
attempts to bring a mass particle within a specified distance of either a location in space or
another mass particle. The desired distance may be 0, or some desired rest length of the
spring. The general formulation of spring energy functions is :


Cspring(x1, x2) = Kspring (| x1 - x2 | - l )                                               (VII.49)


where l is the rest length of the spring. Note that we may select varying values of Kspring for
different springs in the system, resulting in differing types of behavior for individual springs.


There are a variety of useful applications of spring objects in the modeler:


•    As a means for fixing the material in space. Individual mass particles can have springs
     affixed to specific spatial locations. These springs will guide the simulation to a solution
     where the particles remain spatially located near these determined points in space.


•    As a means for user manipulation of the materials. Mass particles may be attached to
     space points indicated by the user. These locations may be interactively manipulated by
     mouse motion. The material particles will attempt to follow the motions of the mouse as
     the simulation progresses. The location indicated by the user may be dynamically
     updated between solution steps.


•    As a means for joining mass particles together. Springs may be attached between two
     mass particles, in which case the solver will attempt to bring these two particles within




                                                                                               229
    some relative distance of each other. Again, this distance may be 0, or some other
    desired length.


There are a number of issues in the use of spring elements to achieve these goals using an
energy based solution. If we are interested in the particle being actually located at a target
point in space, thus the rest length of the spring l = 0. The spring element will compete with
the rest of the objects in the simulation in trying to achieve this goal. Thus if other forces are
pulling on the mass particle to which the spring is affixed, the particle will be only relatively
near the ideal location. The relative strength of the attracting force is dictated by the
magnitude of Kspring. Setting the value of Kspring large relative to the other K values in the
simulation will reduce the distance between the node and the goal locations, but will never
bring the distance to exactly zero. Additionally, making the value of Kspring excessively large
will introduce stiffness into the solution, resulting in a decrease in the stable time step.


An alternative is to simply force the location of the mass particle to a position in space. The
solution of the simulation will provide a displacement of the particle on the basis of the
energy function, but we can presume an additional effect, not included in the solution
formulation, that drives the particle back to the pre-determined location. The result is that
changes in the particle’s location are ignored. This approach works well when the particle is
already at the desired position. But moving the particle instantaneously to a new location will
introduce large deformations in simulation objects related to the particle, which can lead to
instability. Constraining a mass particle to follow exactly a motion specified by mouse
movement will jerk the particle around in space, resulting in idiosyncratic motion of the
particle and associated influxes of kinetic energy into the system if springs are attached to

7.       Gravity and Attraction
A variety of phenomena may be represented by forces acting in a direction in space. A
simple example is the force of gravity acting on the body. This is represented simply as:
fgravity = m ag [0 0 -1]T                                                                    (VII.50)


where m is the mass of particle, and ag the gravitational acceleration.

Other forces may be similarly formulated. An important example is notion of an attractor
force, which exerts a force toward some shape. This may be viewed as a sort of vacuum or,
at closer range, fastening phenomenon, that attempts to draw the material toward an ideal
shape.




                                                                                                231

An example is shown in Figure VII-8, where the paper material is drawn toward a set of
spheres by fastening forces of varying intensities. In the case of a sphere


fsphere = m Ksphere (|x – c| - r) • (x – c)/(|x – c|)                                           (VII.51)


Where c is the location of the center of the sphere, r is the sphere’s radius, and (x – c)/(|x –
c|) is the unit vector from the particle’s location to the center. Other shapes may present
more complicated geometric formulations of gravitation towards the shape, generally directed
along the normal vector to the closest point on the object.


G.      SOLUTION METHOD
So far a number of physical phenomena of interest in the simulation of paper surface
behavior have been described. This section picks up from Section VII.E, presenting the
construction of the global matrices and vectors of Equation (VII.24), and discusses an


                                                                                                   232
efficient method for the solution of this equation, based on the conjugate gradient solution
method.

1.        Matrix Construction
Constraints in the system are formulated using the general equation from (VII.25):
         ∂f     ∂f             ∂f
(M − h      − h2 )∆v = h(f0 + h v0 )
         ∂v     ∂x             ∂x


The formulations discussed in Section VII.VII.F expand on this function by providing the
internal and external constraint functions and their derivatives. If we ignore the velocity based
components of this function and expand, we have:
          ∂f                ∂f
(M − h2      )∆v = hf0 + h2    v0                                                        (VII.52)
          ∂x                ∂x


where the force in the direction i is:
                 ∂C( x )
fi = −ksC( x )                                                                           (VII.53)
                  ∂x i


and the force derivative in the direction of with respect to the direction j is:

∂fi          ∂C( x ) ∂C( x )T ∂ 2C ( x )        
     = −k s                  +           C( x )                                        (VII.54)
∂x j         ∂x       ∂x j     ∂x i ∂x j        
                 i                              




                                                                                             233
Equation (VII.25) may be formulated as a matrix solution of the form Ax=b. The right hand
side of the equation takes the form of a 3n block vector, where the forces acting on the ith
particle are entered in the ith block of the vector. Similarly, the left hand side of the equation,
representing the force derivatives, may be organized as a 3nx3n block matrix, where the (3 X
                                                                                       ∂fi

2.            Numerical Solution
The behavior of a specific constraint in the system affects only a small number of material
particles in the system – specifically:
     •        (3) particles of a given triangle over which stretch and shear forces are considered
     •        (4) particles comprising the two triangles joined at an edge undergoing bending
     •        (2) particles joined by a spring
     •        a single particle connected by a spring to a point in space
The block matrix and block vector entries will be non-zero only for the particles inter-related
by a constraint. The rest of the entries into these constructs will be zero. The linear
independence of the constraints allow constraint entries to be summed.



                                                                                                                 234
Each particle in the system is represented as an object with a state, comprised of its:
   •   mass, mi ∈ R
   •   current position in space, xi ∈ R3
   •   current velocity, vi ∈ R3
   •   index into the global stiffness matrix and force vectors


At the beginning of each time step, the global derivative matrix A is initialized to be equal to
the inverse of the mass matrix 1/M, while the force vector global force vector b is set to 0. A
time step h is considered as input to the solution – the means for determining this time step
is presented in VI.H.3 below.


Each constraint is considered in turn, and for each constraint the related pairs of particles are
considered independently. The energy function C – a scalar - is computed for each
constraint. The derivatives of the constraint’s energy function ∂C( x ) / ∂x i are determined for

each particle associated with the constraint. The second derivatives ∂ 2C ( x )∂x i ∂x j are then

computed for each particle pair.


The force on each particle fi is computed in a straightforward fashion using (VII.53),
multiplied by the time step, and the result added to the global force vector in the particle’s
                            th
associated block – the i         block of the force vector bi. Similarly, the second derivative
                ∂f
component h 2      v0 is computed from the force derivative of the particle, the time step
                ∂x
squared, and the velocity of the particle at the beginning of the time step.


The derivative of the force on particle i with respect to the variation in each of the constraint’s
associated particles j is next computed from the general form (VII.54), and added into the
global force derivative matrix at the block Ai,j . The change in velocity of the particles is
determined by solving the linear equation:
Dv = A-1b                                                                                  (VII.55)


From this result, the new velocities of the particles are computed in a straight forward fashion
by summing the particles’ velocities v0 with Dv. The new particle positions are then computed




                                                                                               235
by adding the multiplying this new velocity by the time step and adding to the original particle
position.


The solution of (VII.55) requires that the inverse of the matrix A be computed. Under the
most general circumstances, this inversion is of order O(n3) complexity – a potentially heavy
penalty in the performance of the backwards Euler simulation approach. However,
characteristics of the matrix can be taken advantage of to reduce the computational
complexity of this inversion. This linear system is sparse, since block matrix elements are
non zero only for those entries corresponding to particles inter-related by constraints: the
neighboring particles in the mesh, or particles joined by springs. The sparisty pattern for a
simple system is illustrate in Figure VII-10 below.


Additionally, since ∂fi / ∂x j = ∂f j / ∂x i the matrix is symmetric. Furthermore the matrix A is

positive definite, since the energy in the system is never less than zero. These conditions are
sufficient to allow the matrix inversion to be conducted numerically, using a conjugate
gradient method70,76. This approach reduces the computational complexity of the matrix
inversion to approximately O(n logn), well justified on the basis of the larger time steps
afforded relative to the forward Euler solution method.

On the basis of the solution method presented above, a prototype interface has been
developed to demonstrate the functionality and user interactions supporting physical
modeling of paper surfaces. Among the goals for the prototype:
     Support modeling of a variety of materials, including paper-like materials and cloth- or
     mesh-like materials,
     Provide intuitive tools for manipulating sheet elements,
     Support the simulation of physical phenomena affecting material placement, including
     cables and fasteners, and features found in real material assemblies such as rips,
     creases, cuts and dodges,
     Allow manipulations in interactive time,
     Provide mechanisms supporting the rationalization of ideal shapes, by guiding material
     assemblies toward these shapes,
     Provide a framework for the automation of rationalization operations, to be discussed in
     Part 3.


The prototype is organized around the dual notions of space presented in Part 2:
     •   A global, Euclidean R3 space, containing material sheets, lights, and other objects
         which interact with sheet entities,
     •   One or more local, R2 material or parametric spaces of the individual sheet entities,
         where interaction with features of the sheets may be manipulated.


Sheet entities thus have a dual representation in the simulator, the 3D potentially deformed
representation in the global space, and a representation of the flattened, “paper space” of the
material itself.




                                                                                           238
                             Figure VII-11: Paper simulator interface


Figure VII-11 shows an overview of the simulator space. A view port into the global 3D
space is on the left, displaying two material sheets positioned in space, and a Bézier surface
attractor object. In the middle are two view ports into the separate 2D spaces corresponding
to the two material sheets. The top view simply displays a grid representing the material
space coordinates of the sheet, while the bottom view displays a graph showing the distance
between the sheet and the attractor. Multiple 2D view ports on individual spaces are
supported. Mouse based interactions support rotation, translation and zooming of the space
view, and mechanisms for positioning and deforming objects in space. Similar capabilities
are supported in the material views, although all such interactions are limited by the two
dimensional nature of the space. At right, a dialog allows editing of the solution parameters.


A variety of geometric object types are supported by the interface; most have potential
implications for the behavior and deformation of material sheets. Geometrics support
individual coloring and, where appropriate, transparency. Examples of 3D spatial objects
supported by the interface include:
•   The material sheet objects themselves




                                                                                            239
•   Various surface based “attractor” objects, suitable for
    representing design surfaces, to be discussed below.
    Currently supported types include spheres, planar polylines,
    and Bézier surface patches.
•   Point lights, affecting the visual appearance of the simulation.


The focus of the simulator is of course concentrated on the
representation of the material sheets themselves. There are               A. Mash view

several modes by which these sheets may be selectively
represented (Figure VII-12), again in spatial (3D) or material (2D)
views:
•   Materials and other objects may be viewed in wireframe
    mode, showing the boundaries and meshes of objects
    (Figure VII-12A).
•   The simulation may be viewed in a simple Phong shaded
                                                                         B. Shaded view
    view (Figure VII-12B),
•   The material meshes may be viewed in a grid paper mode –
    where a texture map is applied to the material sheets,
    applying the (u,v) material coordinates of the sheets (Figure
    VII-12C),    This allows a visualization of the material
    coordinates, and their deformation into space.
•   Environment mapping (Figure VII-12D) provides a “mirrored
    finish” representation of the sheets. This technique is often       C. Grid paper view
    used in product manufacturing applications, since it provides Figure VII-12: Sheet views
    a sense of the localized deformations and other qualities of
    the surfaces.
•   Finally a variety of heuristics about the behavior of the material such as in plane
    deformation, curvature, and distance from some target object in space may be mapped
    onto the sheet surface and visualized (Figure VII-12E).

2.      Meshing
A variety of mechanisms have been developed to support the
modification of sheet elements. The dual nature of material
sheets of having a behavior as a flat sheet, and as a three
dimensional object deformed in space are observed.


Modification of material sheets in 2D form occurs through a
dedicated 2D, Euclidean material world, presented to the user             D. Environment Map

through one or more 2D view ports. The undeformed shape of
the sheet is constructed by insertion of boundaries and other
features into the sheet’s material space. Supported features
include:
•    Sheet boundaries, represented by closed polylines. Users
     may dynamically modify the polylines boundary descriptions,
     by moving the boundaries in 2D space, and by moving,
                                                                            E. Metric graph
     inserting or deleting individual vertices of the polylines.
                                                                           Figure VII-12, ctd.
     Boundaries may self intersect, and more than one individual
     sheet boundary may be included, supporting sheets which
     are not necessarily contiguous. Internal boundaries, representing holes in the sheets are
     also supported. This behavior is analogous to the physical operation of cutting out the
     shape of a sheet from a physical sheet of material.


•    A variety of additional features – instantiating special, localized behavior of the sheets -
     are supported by the interface. These include cut locations, where a physical
     discontinuity is inserted into the material, and “creases” – locations where tangency
     discontinuity may be allowed by the material simulation. These features are generated by
     the user by insertion of linear elements into the sheet’s material space. The user selects
     the behavior of the feature by selecting the desired behavior from the linear element’s
     object modification dialog box. The mechanics of feature insertion are discussed in Part
     3, below.
•    Point objects in material space similarly represent a number of features. Points may
     represent the location of specific nodes in the material mesh, discussed below. They are
     also used to represent areas to be removed from the material, when internal boundaries




                                                                                                 241
   are created. Special point nodes may be inserted to generate the location of spring
   constraints, whose behavior is further modified in world space.


The figure below shows a view of a material sheet generated from a number of the features
described above, including interior and exterior boundaries, a “cut” feature, a region indicated
for material removal, and two spring constraints.




                                Figure VII-13: Sheet modifications



Generation of a mesh from these sheet features is a core capability of the simulator. The
material formulation developed in Section VII.F presumes a material modeled as an
assembly of triangles, joined at edges. The speed of the simulation, in terms of the amount of
computation of an individual time step, and the size of the feasible time step, are directly
related to the number of triangles being solved for. Thus, control of the mesh is a critical
component of achieving interactive simulator behavior. Meshing is achieved by a Delaunay
triangulation algorithm, through a publicly available library provided by Schewchuk77. When a
change of state is indicated by one of the sheet features, the sheet initiates a re-meshing
procedure. Boundaries, segments and vertices are collected into the triangulation structure.
Mesh input node locations are specified in terms of the 2D material space coordinates; the
3D deformation of the mesh has no direct implication on the meshing procedure itself.

coordinates.   For    each    2D    region
corresponding to an individual triangle,
the 3D space plane associated with the
triangle allows a 3D location to be
determined for any vertex whose 2D
coordinates lie in the interior of the
triangle in material coordinates. Changes                   Figure VII-14: Remeshing
in features may result in a new mesh
with vertices that lie outside the existing mesh boundaries. For these vertices, approximate
locations may be determined by considering the plane normal to the closest boundary vertex
of the existing mesh (Figure VII-14). For either interior or exterior vertices, the resulting
location will be only a linearized approximation of the true spatial coordinates of the material.
The re-meshing technique relies on additional solution steps to re-position mesh vertices,
resolving variations in the mesh internal state introduced by the linearized approximation of
vertex positions.


The remainder of the sheet modifications occur through manipulation of the sheet in 3D
spatial views. While the material space modifications affect the envelope of the sheet, and
the inclusion of features, the spatial modification affect the deformation of the sheet and its
response to other objects in the simulation.


The principal means by which sheets are deformed in space occurs by attaching spring
elements to the sheet at user defined locations. These springs may be attached as
permanent fixtures in the simulation, binding a fixed (u,v) location on the surface to a fixed
spatial point. The spatial point may be interactively controlled, by selecting the point and




                                                                                                    243
dragging it to a different
location. Nodes may also be
interactively joined together
with springs, and existing
springs may be interactively
deleted.


The material may also be                   Base Mesh in R3                     Base Mesh in R2

through a command mode
that       allows        dynamic,
temporary         attachment          of
positioning springs. In this
mode, the user grabs the
material by holding down a
mouse      button       while        the                     Mesh Refinement

cursor is over one of the
material’s mesh points. A
spring       is        temporarily

material     point       and         the
spatial    point      under          the
cursor. Holding down the

drag the temporary spring’s
spatial point through space.
Releasing the mouse button
removes         the     temporary

very similar to physically

elect to make the spring permanent – fixing the material point permanently to the desired
location.

3.     Attractor Objects
The simulator is not simply intended to allow interactive manipulation of sheet materials. A
second important application is to allow the rationalization of ideal surface shapes. This use
is addressed by allowing the selective application of an attractive force between the material
sheets and other shapes in the simulation. A variety of spatial objects support this attractive
force, including sphere objects and smoothly continuous surface objects based on Bézier
surface patches.


The attractor force is represented as a force between each of the material points in the
sheet, and the closest point of the closest attracting object in the simulation. For each object
in the simulation comprised of a smoothly continuous surface, the closest point to a given
material point will be point on the object whose surface normal passes through the material
points location in R3. For spheres this is an easy computation, since this normal will be
aligned with the line between the material point and the sphere’s center point. For Bézier
surfaces, a algorithm is used that finds this point on the surface65. For each of the sheet’s
mesh vertices, these closest point algorithms are run for each attractor object in the
simulation, and the closest of these points is selected as the actual attractor object. A force in
the direction of the vector between the mesh point and the surface normal point of the
attractor is enacted on the mesh point. The strength of this attractive force is controlled by a
parameter set globally for the simulation.


The effect is to draw the sheet materials to objects in the simulation. At the same time, the
material’s internal constraints counteract the tendency of the attractor objects to deform the
sheet into a potentially infeasible shape. The magnitude of this force must of course be
limited, so that the attractive force does not overwhelm the internal material constraints.

4.         Solution
The material formulation is solved in an independent processor thread from the graphics
display and user interactions, to support additional speed on multiprocessing machines.
Initially a candidate time step h is provided based on the previous solution history. The solver
traverses all entities exhibiting constraint behavior, determines the necessary derivatives,
and populates the solution matrix and vector with the appropriate numerical values for the
constraint. The block matrices for each particle pair and block vectors for each particle are
cumulatively summed for all the constraints in the simulation.

Once the solution matrix and vector have been determined, these objects are passed to a
conjugate gradient solution subsystem, which inverts the solution matrix. The velocities and
new particle positions are then computed. The results are then tested for behavior
suggesting that the simulation has achieved instability. If such conditions are found, the
simulation is rolled back to the previous state, the time step is reduced and the materials
solution is repeated. If the solution is found to be stable, the state of the mass particles is
updated to reflect the solution, and the solution process is re-started at the new time state.
The solution process solves continuously until halted by the user, or until the solution has
converged to within specified velocity / acceleration tolerances.


In order to maximize solution efficiency, it is important to make distinctions among
components of the solution that vary at each time step and components which are invariant


                                                                                                                      247
as long as the 2D mesh remains the same. Different user or simulation events may trigger
refreshing of either or both of these sets of components. Changes in sheet features requiring
a change of the mesh will require a refresh of time invariant components. Changes requiring
a refresh of time invariant components will require re-generation of the time dependent
components as well.


Components of the solution which are invariant over time steps include:
•      The mesh topology, including vertex / edge / triangle structure and adjacencies
•      Vertex material coordinates, and components of the solution determined solely from
       material coordinates, including the triangle derivates Du1,Du2,Dv1,Dv2, and the inverse
                                            −1

•      The size and sparsity structures of the solution matrix A and vector b from Section
       VII.G.1.
•      The mass matrix M, and a pre-conditioning matrix for the conjugate gradient solver
       M-1.


Components of the solution that are time variant, and must be re-generated at each step
include:
•      The spatial coordinates of end locations for fixed springs – if modified by users,
•      Changes in material or constraint constants, including stretch, shear, bending, and
       spring forces.
•      Spatial coordinates, velocity and Dv vectors for all mass particles,
•      The energy function derivates
•      The numerical valuation of the solution matrix and vector A and b,



5.     Time step selection and instability detection
The initial time step for the solution is provided by a default, or provided by the user through
a dialog box. In order to achieve computational efficiency of the solution, the time step should
be as large as possible without resulting in instability. Unfortunately, there is no determinate
way to compute either the appropriate time step or to detect for instability. Additionally, the
size of a stable time step varies over the course of the simulation. For example, a flat mesh
with no acceleration or constraints can be solved for an indeterminately large time step

                                                                                            248
(although the results aren’t particularly interesting!). Heuristics are employed to search for an
appropriately large time step, and to check the solution to determine whether instability has
occurred.


If the previous solution was achieved in a stable manner, the current time step may be
increased slightly. We multiply the existing time step by a small factor, which may be set by
the user. A default multiplier of 110% is used for increasing the time step between
subsequent stable solutions. If the solution is determined to be unstable, a more drastic
reduction multiplier (default 70%) is used to get the solution quickly back on track, with the
knowledge that subsequent stable solutions will soon get the solution moving forward again
quickly.


There are a number of heuristics that can be employed to check for stability. The most
obvious and direct is to check for what seem like dangerous changes in velocity – the Dv
resulting from the solution of the matrix equation. An excessive deformation of any triangle
edge relative to its undeformed configuration may also signal impending instability.

I.     ISOMETRIES
The materials modeling formulation presented in this chapter offers some substantial
improvements over the existing paper surface representations currently employed in the
firm’s digital process. The principal benefits of the materials simulation representation are the
result of a more sophisticated representation of the actual constraints imposed by the surface
materials on project forms. The material formulation provides the solution of paper surface
configurations internally, allowing the user to interact with the surfaces in a manner similar to
that provided by physical sheet materials. Certain features of physical sheet forms are quite
difficult to reconstruct using constrained gaussian curvature approaches, and are prohibited
by developable surface representations.


At the same time, the material simulation representation has much in common with these
representations, by virtue of their shared topological basis as <R2 x R3 > manifolds. This
shared topological basis suggests some additional comparisons of these representations,
and allows the possibility for either integrating these representations into a common
framework.

In describing the parametric representation of these surfaces a occurring in a proper
Euclidean space, we have taken on certain structures of this space that deserve further
inquiry. Specifically, our parametric space representation assumes the character of a metric
space, with length and distance metrics defined on the coordinate descriptions of elements
within the space. This distance metric forms the basis for establishing continuity and
proximity of points within a region of parametric space associated with the sheet. We might
inquire what other implications the structuring of a parametric space distance metric has on
our problem description.


The topology of neighborhoods is preserved under transformation between parametric and
world space representations. Whether or not distances are preserved is dependent on the
nature of the mapping function F : D → R. In general, little affinity between the distance,
curvature or other shape qualities is preserved under parametric ↔ world space mappings.
As an example, isometric curves of the form u = uC (v = vC) are represented as straight
vertical (horizontal) lines in parametric space. Their shape characteristics in world space are
dictated by the form of the mapping function σ. In the case of Bézier formulation, this function
takes on the form of the Bézier basis function to the tensor product surface σ:
               n   m
σ (u, v ) = ∑∑ Bi ,n (u ) B j ,m (v ) Pi , j
              i =0 j =0
                                                                                        (VII.56)
                  n!
Bi ,n (u ) =              u i (1 − u )n − i
             i !(n − i )!


The shape of the isoparametric curves in R3 is defined by this shape function, and specified
through the placement of the control points Pi,j in R3. In general, there is little we can say
about the shape of an isoparametric curve in R3 from its properties in R2 beyond such
topological properties as connectedness and continuity. For this reason, isoparametric
curves on surfaces, while readily available in most CAD surface applications, are of little use
in constructibility applications. In general, shape functions such as length and curvature are
not preserved across parametric surface mappings, so the parametric space representation
of surfaces are of little interest in design applications.

Figure VII-18C represents a notable exception, where the configuration of surface control
points results in a cylindrical developable surface. If scaling or other affine transformations
are controlled, the parametric surface mapping will be an isometry: length and gaussian
curvature are bi-directionally preserved.


There are classes of surfaces on which important shape metrics may be preserved across
parametric mappings. These surfaces are of great importance to paper surface modeling.
Developable surfaces present admit a two dimensional representation of interest in design.
As with other parametric surfaces, the mapping between parametric and world space


                                                                                           251
configurations do not preserve shape functions. However, developable surfaces may be
isometrically developed, unfolded into an alternative Euclidean 2-space configuration.
Length, distance, geodesic curvature, and other shape functions are bi-directionally
preserved across this transformation. Note that the developed 2-space and parametric space
representations are distinct. Topological properties are retained across both transformations.


Developability plays a critical role in Gehry’s process. Developing of surfaces allows surface
panels to be unfolded into patterns that can be cut from flat sheet. Other component
geometry such as fastener locations, panel breaks, and intersections with other construction
systems may be mapped between the developed and world space configurations. Note,
however, that this developed surface space is not to be confused with the parametric space
representation that structures the initial coordinization of the surface.

We may now make an important observation on the materials modeling surface
representation.   The    materials   modeling     representation    is   predicated    on    a   tight
correspondence between the shape of a sheet’s undeformed configuration as a region of



                                                                                                 252
material space, and its deformed configuration in R3. The energy functions presented in
Section VII.F are described by stretch and shear deformation, computed from the derivatives
of the mapping function.


In applying the physical modeling approach to paper surfaces, we are principally concerned
with materials where the in plane stretch and shear siffness is quite high compared to
bending and other force phenomena. We can achieve large scale deformations of the sheet’s
configuration in world space while incurring insubstantial deformation in the sheet.


If we presume small in-plane deformation of the surface in its R3 configuration, the mapping
between parametric and world spaces will be approximately isometric. Qualitatively, we can
observe this fact in the material simulations presented in Chapter VII and below. Lengths,
angles and geodesic curvatures are preserved between geometric features in parametric
space and their transformed counterparts on the surface in R3.

                    Figure VII-20: Isometries of the materials based formulation


The material space representation thus has an important spatial and design quality. It is the
originating, two dimensional paper space of the surface in its flat, pre-configured state.
Designed objects draw important shape qualities from their occupancy of this space. Cuts
and other operations performed by designers on the materials are appropriately represented
by shape features in material space. The impacts of these features’ shapes on the feasible


                                                                                             253
configurations of the sheet in R3 are also represented. In particular, linear elements in
material space are mapped to geodesic curves in the world space configuration. The material
modeling approach thus supports two critical designers’ views on the elements that are being
operated on: the paper space of the sheet and operations in the plane of the surface, and the
subsequent deformation of these sheets into spatial configurations.


The common manifold framework underlying these representations suggests the opportunity
for performing mapping operations between these surface constructs. In particular, the
developable surface representation offers the feature of straight lines of ruling, which were
shown to be of interest in fabrication. It is of interest to be able to map between developable
surface and materials surface representations, drawing on developable surface constraints
on project applications where the associated constructibility opportunities are warranted, and
switching over to a more generous paper surface representation on other areas of the
project.


The mapping from a developable surface representation to one based on materials
simulation is can be performed in a fairly straight forward manner. Developable surfaces
provide the unfolded, 2-space representation of its developed configuration. This
representation of the surface can be directly converted to the triangulated region of R2 space
associated with the materials simulation approach. The coordinates of the surface in R3 can
similarly be provided to the equivalent materials based spatial representation. Figure VII-21
shows this mapping, a capability provided by the material simulation prototype.


The reverse mapping, unfortunately, is not as straight forward. The physical modeling
representation is a super set of developable surfaces. While all developable surface forms
can be represented by the physical modeling approach to arbitrary accuracy, the
representation of physically modeled forms as developable surfaces requires a
rationalization strategy, and is likely to encounter conditions of infeasibility.

J.     MATERIALS MODELING APPLICATION: GUGGENHEIM INSTALLATION
The first application of the materials modeling prototype on a Gehry project occurred in June,
2001, on a sculptural installation in the Gehry Retrospective show, installed in the rotunda of
the New York Guggenheim museum. The sculpture called for the installation of 10 steel
mesh curtains, to be hung from the concrete radial structural members supporting the
skylight of Wright’s design. The curtain assembly was to be constructed out a wire mesh
material, comprised of interwoven spirals of steel wire oriented approximately horizontally.
The curtains were built up out of three layers of the material, separated approximately 6” by
wire spacers. The curtains were to be positioned by a series of cables attached from the
curtains to points on the ceilings of the galleries neighboring the rotunda.


An initial design for the installation was developed during approximately three months prior to
the opening of the exhibit. Each of the curtains was designed to be suspended the full height
of the rotunda, from an attachment mechanism on the skylight structural members to a height
of approximately 10’ above the rotunda floor, for an approximate vertical dimension of 80’.


The cables would be connected to two parallel steel rods, attached to the mesh face, and
located approximately ¼ of the distance from the edges of each panel. These steel rods
would provide additional stiffness of the material in the vertical direction, and locally stiffen
the material, to minimize distortion of the material at the points of connection to the cables.
From its initial position oriented radially aligned with the skylight structural members, each
curtain would describe an S-shaped curve, sweeping downward and clockwise in a similar
sense to the organization of the rotunda parapet and galleries, until it eventually aligned
roughly with the surface of the rotunda parapet.


Each of the curtain assemblies was to be tied back from both sides of the curtain at each
level of the rotunda. The Guggenheim required that no attachments be made into the
surfaces facing the rotunda itself. Additional structural requirements of the galleries dictated
that attachments for tension cables be placed in a ring approximately 12’ outward from the
parapet edge into the ceiling of the galleries.




                                                                                             256
        Figure VII-22: Original developable surface scheme (Guggenheim mesh installation)


An initial computer model of the assembly was made prior to installation (Figure VII-22). The
curtains were represented as developable surfaces, as an initial approximation of the
behavior the sheet material of the mesh would assume. It was assumed that the strength of
the wire mesh in the horizontal direction, coupled with the rigidity of the vertical bars, would
generate a material behavior that was approximately equivalent to that presented by
developable surfaces. The cables would be attached at a sufficient number of locations to
allow the surface form to be guided into position during site installation. In this scheme, the
intention was to allow cables to pierce neighboring curtains as necessary to generate the
desired shape. The developable surface models of the curtains were flattened to produce


                                                                                            257
patterns for material cut-out. Two weeks before the opening of the exhibition, the cut out
sheets were sent to the museum for on site installation by the project designers and museum
installation staff.


On-site installation of the sculpture was problematic. The large size of the sheets, combined
with the spatial confines of the rotunda space, and museum staff’s concern for the integrity of
the rotunda’s structure and finish, all impeded interactive adjustment of the sheet’s fastening
strategy. The strategy of piercing neighboring sheets with tie back cables proved
problematic, since it was difficult to know exactly where the cable should feed through. Most
importantly, the sheets did not behave like the paper surfaces presented by the developable
surface based geometry model. The material proved to be far more flexible than initially
understood, and the effects of gravity on the material caused it to sag substantially between
fastening points. The opening of the display occurred with only half of the sheets installed,
most in temporary, pinned back locations.


After the opening of the exhibition, it was decided to attempt another study of the sheet
sculpture, and a second round of installation. The study was conducted through the use of
the materials modeling application. Two weeks were allocated for the study.


The design assumptions and conditions during this phase of the sculpture’s design were
substantially fixed by decisions made in the initial design phase. The sizes and shapes of the
sheets were already defined and had already been fabricated. On the basis of these
conditions, and with the initial design intent serving as a point of departure, the simulator was
used to develop a strategy for establishing cable configurations that generated a form
acceptable to the project designers.


Additional design guidelines were established. Configurations involving cables punching
through neighboring panels were avoided, due to the difficulty of controlling locations of cable
punch throughs with sufficient precision. A maximum of four attachment points per sheet was
established.




                                                                                             258
The existing fabricated profiles of the curtains
proved to be a major constraint on the
configurations that could be achieved. The
bottom dimension of the panels was larger
than the distance along the rotunda edge. This
created problems for configurations where
cables were to be attached to both sides of a
panel, since these cables would invariable
intersect the neighboring panels.


The simulator program was modified to include
the effects of gravity on the materials.            Figure VII-23: Initial design proposal based on
                                                                 materials simulation.
Capabilities for importing sheet boundaries
from existing CAD packages were added, along with capabilities for importing the geometry
of the rotunda. The meshing program was modified to allow nodes along the top edge of the
panel at the skylight structure to be fixed in space.


An initial strategy was proposed, where the
panels would be attached at three points at the
lowest level of the rotunda: one point on the
outer edge (from the rotunda center), and two
points on the inner edge, a third of the
horizontal dimension from the edge (Figure
VII-23). This layout would allow both edges to
be controlled, while preventing the cables from
intersecting    the     neighboring      panels.
Additionally, the strategy would produce an “S”     Figure VII-24: Dimensional data from simulator
                                                              for sheet placement on site
curve in the panel, both vertically and across
the bottom edge of the panel. When the
design had been established, information delineating the strategy was sent to the museum,
including precise locations for cable attachments on the panels, locations for attachment to
the gallery structure, and individual cable lengths (Figure VI-24).




                                                                                                259

     Figure VII-25: Recalibration of material properties based on initial installation results


This second round of installation produced additional surprises for the design and modeling
team. The material proved to be even more flexible than assumed during the material
simulation, causing the panel to collapse under the effects of gravity. This resulted in a
severe S-curve in the bottom edge of the panel, a result found undesirable by the project
designers (Figure VII-25). On the basis of the mockup result, the strategy of attachment on
the panel interiors was found to not be workable and was abandoned.


The material parameters were modified to correspond with the results from the mockup
study, and a new set of configurations were attempted in the simulator. The driving concern
at this point in the design was to produce a strategy that could accommodate the flexibility of
the panel, while allowing cables to pass outside of adjoining panels. A special feature was
developed in the simulator graphics that would allow multiple copies of a single sheet to be
visualized, rotated around the rotunda. This allowed the relative positioning of the sheets and
cables to be assessed as the sheet was interactively moved. Figure VII-26 shows some of
the intermediate schemes produced through design iterations with the materials simulator.


                                                                                                 260

           Figure VII-26: Materials simulation design iterations of mesh curtain installation

The design team finally settled on a strategy where each panel would curve “above and over”
its neighbor, prior to being attached at the outside edge only. This strategy required
attachments higher up on the panels. The distances between the panels would be tight at
this the point of passing over, so the prediction of the materials modeler would have to be
substantially correct. On the basis of this scheme, data was again sent to the museum for on
site mock up.


This time, the results of the mock up confirmed the assumptions of the simulator, and the
feasibility of the strategy. Dimensions for cable placement on the flat patterns of the
individual sheets, cable lengths, and locations for cable attachment points in the rotunda
were established for each panel. These dimensions were again provided to team as per
Figure VII-24 above.

final mesh curtain installation in the exhibit.

VIII. GENERATING ASSEMBLIES

In Part 1 of this thesis, a set of issues were identified in the rationalization, documentation
and constructibility of Gehry’s surface forms. The notion was presented of materially guided
intentions and systems in the physical modeling, digital modeling and fabrication of these
forms. The class of “paper surfaces” were introduced in Part 2, shapes whose qualities are
defined by a set of specific material behaviors and constructibility requirements. Issues in the
computational modeling of these materially guided surfaces and systems were presented.


This section extends these geometric constructs – initially developed toward simulating the
geometric behavior of individual material surfaces - to consider the behavior of surface
elements as they combine to form larger organizations. The motivation for this work will be to
direct the mathematical constructs developed in Part 2 toward solutions of constructibility
issues on larger scale compositions of sheet assemblies. This effort will specifically target
rationalization activities, developing approaches to the generation of surface element
assemblies whose organizations are guided by rules of constructibility and other project
performance requirements.


In order to apply the formalisms developed previously in this work to the rationalization of
surface assemblies, we must extend the previously defined geometric models of paper
surfaces in two fundamental ways:


1. Extension of the topological model. The constructs developed in Part 2 focused on the
notion of an R2 manifold embedded in Euclidean 3-space. The Euclidean structuring of the
parametric space representation provided certain regularity to the descriptions of the sheet
elements, regularity unavailable from a perspective based purely on the sheets’ description
in the containing 3-space. Certain topological properties such as connectedness of the
shape’s region and its relationship to its boundary were identified on the basis of the sheets’
parametric space descriptions.


Extending this approach to inspect assemblies of elements will require extending the
topological model of surfaces as manifolds to consider the ways in which these spatial
representations combine. Well established theory of such combinatoric topologies exists2,38.
In applying these topological combinatorics to the construction of sheet assemblies, we will


                                                                                            265
principally be concerned with operations performed on the boundaries of sheet elements as
they are “stitched together” to form larger organizations. This inquiry will provide a
mathematical basis to support operations on organizations of surface manifolds.


2. Generative operations on surface assemblies. With a formal structure in place to
structure the description of surface element assemblies, the inquiry will turn toward ways in
which operations on these assemblies may be performed. Rationalization operations will be
re-formulated as transformation operations on assemblies, directed toward goals of satisfying
performance metrics on these assemblies. The topological structuring of sheet assemblies
may be drawn on to support contemporary approaches to the development of generative
systems.


With these structures in place, we will have a basis for formally defining shape families or
classes, on the basis of sets of assumptions regarding element geometric representation,
organizations of elements and operations on these elements. A shape class may be defined
by a description of the type of geometric element used, and the allowable organizations of
these elements. Alternatively, we can view the shape class as the set of all shapes
generated from a specification of elements and transformations. Both aspects of this
description provide constraints on the feasible set of “valid” shapes. A shape is a member of
a shape class if it can be generated using only the assumptions valid in the definition of the
class. If the organizational rules have been developed in response to constructibility
requirements then, by definition, satisfactory inclusion of candidate shapes into an
appropriately defined shape class will guarantee satisfaction of these constructibility
requirements, and any shape which is a member of the class will satisfy these requirements.
Specific surface fabrication and construction systems will be closely associated with a
specific shape class.




                                                                                          266
An example paper surface composition from
Gehry’s schematic design phase modeling is
shown in Figure VIII-1at right. Intuitively, there
is a language of forms apparent in this
construction. We recognize elements of this
language: the sheets of paper and felt. In turn,
these elements are assembled with a more or
less consistent set of operations on these
base elements. The shape is constructed by
cutting sheets of material, folding these sheets
in space, and joining these elements together
at their boundaries. Frequently, adjustments to
the boundary of an element are made on the
model, trimming the boundaries of joined
elements to a closed configuration.


The boundaries of sheets and their joining to
neighbors are clearly important characteristics
                                                     Figure VIII-1:Physical sketch model, showing
contributing to the overall shape. It will be             two shape classes (Ohr Museum)
beneficial to have available the description of a sheet by its boundary configuration in an
unfolded or “flattened” state, as this representation is an invariant characteristic of the sheet’s
shape, independent of its manipulations in 3D space. The relationship between these
perspectives was developed in the materials modeling approach in Chapter VII. There are
additional, higher level features which merit consideration. “Dodges” and “inserts “ are
evident – sheets that have been split and either the edges closed or additional material
added. Sheets may also overlap, providing an alternative construct generating continuity of
the surface assembly.



A.     GENERATIVE SYSTEMS AND SHAPE GRAMMARS
The notion of elements and transformational operations on these elements is at the heart of
work in shape grammar theory and method. This theory provides an algebraic basis to
describe shapes through topologies of shape – part relations.

The basic algebraic components of shape grammars are often presented in the literature80
as:


A→B                                                                                        (VIII.1)
C ≥ τ (A)                                                                                  (VIII.2)
C → C - τ(A) + τ(B)                                                                        (VIII.3)


Equation (VIII.1) establishes the transformation rule to be considered for application. Shape
A, identified in some field of consideration is replaced with a separate shape B. Typically, the
field of consideration in which this identification will occur is a design - an existing shape C.


Equation (VIII.2) defines the identification operation by which the transformation rule is
applied to a design C. Some transformation of A is identified as being a part of the design
shape C. In the existing literature, this transformation is presumed to be one of the Euclidean
transformations.


Finally, Equation (VIII.3) presents the production operations on the base shape C, given the
defined transformation, and the identification circumstances identified in (VIII.2).


Often, grammar applications to design applications presume multiple transformation rules,
operating sequentially on a progressively developed design shape. A grammar is defined in
(Stiny, Gips84, 81) as a 4-tuple of the form:
S = < VT, VM, R, I>                                                                         (VIII.4)


where:
      •   VT is a finite a set of terminal shapes, a spatially organized set of (maximal) Euclidean
          elements
      •   VM is a finite a set of marker shapes, a spatially organized set of (maximal) Euclidean
          elements
      •   R is a finite set of transformation rules, of the form u → v , where u and v are shapes
          composed of shapes from VT and VM .

                                                                                               268
    •    I is an initial shape on which transformation R are applied.


Marker shapes serve to uniquely direct the application of rules to specific shapes in the
composition, and to drive the application of rules in a deterministic fashion. The grammar
terminates when there are no marker shapes left in the composition.


The possibility of such operations is founded on a topology of shapes and parts of shapes.
Initial literature76 presents the basis for an algebra of shapes, using examples of Euclidean
elements (points, lines, planar regions, volumes) and transformations of these elements
(translation, rotation, scaling, mirroring). Shapes are sets of elements. Shape A is part of
another shape B (A < B) in such case that every element of shape A is contained in some
element of B. This allows a topology of shapes to be developed on the partial ordering of
shape – subshape relationships. A Boolean algebra may then be defined on shapes, their
sums, products, and complements, on the basis of this topology of shapes.


This topological structuring of shapes bears some
similarity to earlier results of point set topology43. In
point set topology, a shape is defined simply as a set
of points. The structuring of Euclidean and other                  -            =
                   7
metric    spaces        supports   the   development    of
neighborhoods          as   a   means    for   determining
connectedness and compactness of point sets. In this
formalism, shape – subshape relations and algebras            Subtraction operation on different
                                                             element types in point set topology
on shapes are replaced with a topology of point sets.
The point set (shape) A is a part (subshape) of B
(read a < b) iff every point in A is also in B.                    -            =

Shape grammar literature diverges from point set
theory in that point set operations do not preserve the        Corresponding shape grammar
                                                              operation, preserving shape types
type or identity of shapes25. In point set topology, the
subtraction of a point interior to a line from the line      Figure VIII-2: Point set versus shape
                                                                     grammar subtraction
results in two lines, or a line with a single point
missing (Figure VIII-2). Shape grammars admit Boolean operations only on elements of like
types, so the above example has no effect on the line element.


                                                                                               269
In much of the original literature by Stiny83, the shape grammar formalism is described
through examples of Euclidean elements (lines, points, and higher dimensional shapes
described by boundaries comprised of these elements) and Euclidean transformations. Stiny
has shown that Euclidean shape grammars are closed under transformation. The regularities
of such well defined objects, operated on in Euclidean space, lend a simplicity and elegance
to the structuring of computations on these objects.


The introduction of non-Euclidean spatial structures into shape grammar theory requires us
to re-consider the structure of shape grammars, distinguishing between elements of the
formalism that are topological or algebraic in nature, and which are assumptions based on
Euclidean characteristics of the space in which elements are described and transformed.
Specifically, we wish to re-cast previous work on Euclidean space grammars into a form
which can represent - and support operations on - more general manifolds.


Earl24 develops further the topological structuring of shapes and their subshapes, and
develops a treatment of shapes and their boundaries. This argument assumes
connectedness and continuity of the space in which operations occur. These characteristics
require that the space in which operations occur adopt the characteristics of a metric space
(Section V.A), but do not require this metric space to be necessarily Euclidean. As such,
Earle’s formulation of shape – boundary relations are potentially applicable to the non-
Euclidean realm of surface manifolds without modification.


The elements (lines and points) on which grammars operate are considered to be elemental,
in a manner similar to Euclid38 – constructs whose definition is implicit, and shared between
author and reader. In computational applications, explicit descriptions of these elements
must be formulated45,46. This explicit definition of shapes through numerical evaluations is
sometimes perceived as an effort in mechanics, whose relationship to the algebraic
formalisms of grammars is ill defined.

B.      MANIFOLD GRAMMARS

1.      Introduction
In Part 2 of this thesis, the description of surface shapes was developed through the
structuring of manifolds. This section considers the formalisms necessary to adopt shape
grammar theory to such shapes.


The structures of manifold theory provide the basic structures necessary and sufficient to
establish algebras of shapes as presented above:
     The notion of Cartesian product spaces, including spaces of real numbers Rn and vector
     product spaces. The existence of metric functions on these spaces, necessary to define
     closure, continuity and neighborhoods or bounded regions, is presumed.
     Transformations or mapping functions between these spatial constructs.


It can be shown that these structures are sufficient to support the constructs associated with
shape grammar theory:
     The notions of shapes, and spaces in which these shapes occur,
     Topologies of shape – part relationships, sufficient to allow the definition of Boolean
     algebras,
     Transformations on shapes.


In the conventional formalism of shape grammars, shapes are seen as entities occurring in,
and distinct from, the spaces they inhabit. Manifold theory makes no such distinction
between space and shape. Instead, a shape is perceived as a mapping or contract between
two distinct spatial constructs, one intrinsic to the shape and presumed to be locally
Euclidean, the other extrinsic, into which the shape is embedded or resides. The notion of a
shape in analogously viewed in manifold theory as a transformational function that binds
together, or translates between, spatial views of the object. This definition of shape-as-
function is the basis for the shape’s identity79, and provides the basis for this identity to be
preserved through transformations on the shape. Closure operators83 may be defined on
these functions. The structuring of shape-as-function furthermore consolidates the definition
of the shape with a functional definition necessary to perform numerical computations.




                                                                                            271
Shapes described as mapping functions take on the topological characteristics of an M × N
product space define by their relationship on these spaces. This product space not
necessarily Euclidean nature, even if the spaces M are N. Rather, the manifold takes on
spatial qualities determined by the mapping function. For differentiable maps, metric
functions analogous to that Euclidean distance can be determined. Topologies of
neighborhoods are typically preserved across this mapping.


As point of departure, we may consider trivial example of a line segment in R2, defined as an
R1 × R2 manifold. A might may be defined is a function of two R2 vectors:

λ : t → p + t q | t ∈ ( 0,1)                                                              (VIII.5)


although certainly other equivalent definitions of the line function might be used. The
boundaries of λ are the 0-dimensional points p and p + q.


The line λ may be viewed equivalently from three distinct spatial perspectives:
    as a closed region of the real line t,
    as a line element embedded in Euclidean 2-space,
    as a function or constraint defined in the <R × R2 > product space.
This last perspective is perhaps the least obvious, but most important perspective on the
nature of this element. In the case of the above stated line definition (VIII.5), the line forms a
constraint on the three variables of the product space (t, u1, u2):


( t,p1
         + tq1, p1 + tq1   )                                                              (VIII.6)


We often state as a condition for further extensions of the manifold structuring that the
mapping function is invertible. In the case of the line, we can define an inverse function
λ −1 : u → t , which maps from Euclidean 2-space parameters back to locations on the scalar
         i




number line t. A point on this line with R2 coordinates ui maps to a point in line t by the vector
dot product:
                q
t = (u − p )                                                                              (VIII.7)
                q




                                                                                              272
This inverse mapping is obviously only valid for regions R2 that are in the image of the
original mapping function λ.


With this invertible function in hand, we may establish a topology of parts between similarly
defined elements. Given two line segments l2 and l1 :
λ1 : t1 → p1 + t 1q1 | t1 ∈ ( 0,1) ,
                                                                                               (VIII.8)
λ2 : t 2 → p2 + t 2q2 | t 2 ∈ ( 0,1)


with inverse functions:
λ1−1 : u1 → t1
λ2−1 : u2 → t 2
We can determine product functions that map between the parametric space descriptions of
these lines:

 λ1→2 : t1 → t 2 , t 2 = λ2 o λ1 ( t1 )
                             −1

                                                                                               (VIII.9)
 λ2→1 : t 2 → t1, t1 = λ1 o λ2 ( t2 )
                            −1




A topology of part relations can be defined on these functions and their embeddings into a
common space. A line segment λ2 is a part of λ1 (λ1 ≥ λ2 ) in such case that the function λ2→1

maps t2 into t1 on the range t1 = λ2→1 ( t 2 ) ∈ ( 0,1) . Production rules for determination of maximal

elements may similarly be established. If t1 (p1 ) < λ2→1 (p2 ) < t1 (p1 + q1 ) < λ2→1 (p2 + q2 ) then

the maximal line λ1 + λ2 may be defined as the function:

λ1+ 2 : t → p1 + t ( λ2→1 (p2 + q2 ) − p1 ) | t ∈ ( 0,1)                                      (VIII.10)


Coordinates on λ2 may be mapped into this new parameterization. Operations of
complement (-) and product (.) are similarly established.


This approach to grammars on manifolds may be extended directly to higher order manifolds
of arbitrary dimensions <Rm × Rn>. In this thesis, our focus is on surface elements,
embedded in R3. The structuring of manifolds is naturally extended to the descriptions and
transformations of surfaces and their combinatorics.

Part        relations          can       be
determined            on      parametric                                        σ1
surfaces embedded into a
common Euclidean 3-space.
Figure       VIII-3      demonstrates
this        relationship          for        2-
manifolds embedded in R3.

Two surfaces:
σ 1 : U ∈ (u1 ) → R 3

V      of     distinct        parametric                                        σ2
spaces into a common 3-                           Figure VIII-3: Mapping of Euclidean space shape transformations

                                                                            ∞
functions σ1-1 and σ 2-1 can be determined. σ 1 and σ 2 are C related by σ 1 ° σ 2-1 and σ 1-1 ° σ 2

, if U ∩ (σ 1-1 ° σ 2 )V ≠ ∅. If (σ 1-1 ° σ 2 )V ≤ U , then σ 2 is a part of σ 1.


Transformations on manifolds are
similarly described. The Euclidean
transformations             of     conventional
shape grammars are mappings of
the form τ: Rn→Rn where Euclidean
space elements of dimension n are                                                σ -1
transformed            by        the     mapping                                                     τ
function, then re-embedded back
into the containing Euclidean n-
space. For example, rotation about
the origin in R2 may be defined as
the 2 × 2 mapping function28:

              cos θ       − sinθ  u                                              σ
τ ( u, v ) =                                                                                            (VIII.11)
               sinθ       cos θ  v 

                                                             Figure VIII-4: Mapping of shape transformations




                                                                                                               274
Transformations of this sort may readily be extended to manifold grammars. As an example,
a transformation of a surface region in R3, N ∈ σ (u ) , may be conducted as a transformation

in the parametric space of the surface. The transformation of this embedded region is
constructed as the contract between the parametric space rotational transformation and the
mapping functions (Figure VIII-4):


τ (N ) : R 3 → R 3
                                                                                             (VIII.12)
      = σ o τ o σ −1 ( N )


These examples illustrate an important aspect of the structuring of manifolds. Manifolds
contract together to form more complex constructions. The “output” of one mapping serves
as the “input” of a second mapping.            The resulting object may be viewed from the
perspective of its initial occupancy of the initial space, its final spatial configuration, or any of
the intermediate spatial organizations.


This structuring was drawn
                                                           σ (α(t))

may       be         equivalently
viewed           from           the

    configuration in R3 through the composite manifold structure x = σ o α ( t ) ,

    or, if se so choose, even in composite <R1 × R2 × R3> that results as a product of the
    mapping.
Although we posit that these representations are “equivalent”, there is obviously additional
complexity to viewing this object in higher order spaces as a consequence of the additional
structuring imposed by the composite mapping. As we move toward developing grammars


                                                                                                     275
on manifold objects, it will be beneficial to have any and all of these spatial views available in
which we may choose at our discretion to define elements of the grammar. The mapping
functions allow us to “know” a great deal about an object’s higher order behavior, while still
performing computations in reduced spatial representations to take advantage of problem
simplifications afforded in these spaces.



2.     Other Topological Spaces
So far, this discussion has focused on manifolds defined in real number Cartesian product
spaces Rn, to provide the basis for establishing differentiable mapping functions between
spatial views on these objects. In many shape grammar applications, such real valued
geometric descriptions alone are insufficient to capture the semantic requirements of the
problem.


Labels and Weights
In Stiny’s shape grammar formulation, labels and weights82 present examples of such not-
necessarily real valued or geometric shape attributes. Labels are, roughly, tokenized
information, which may be bound to shapes in a design. As an example, lines on an
architectural plan may represent materials; the set of material tokens may include {WOOD,
CONCRETE, SHEET_ROCK, etc.}. Elements of different labellings do not combine in the
Stiny’s. Production rules employing multiple labeled elements may be considered to be
grammars operating as parallel grammars, operating in the distinct spaces associated with
each label. Weights may be considered to be values associated with design elements. These
values may combine according to production rules. The product of a line of color RED and
one colored YELLOW may be defined in a production rule to result in a line of color
ORANGE.


The structure of manifold grammars naturally extends to include such additional, non-spatial
parameters. In manifold theory, there is no distinction between variables that are spatial and
those that are not. The inclusion of additional, real valued parameters on a manifold simply
requires the extension of the problem formulation into a higher order space. For example, a
colored line could be formulated as a 4-Dimensional object of the form < t × R × G × B >,
where R, G and B are the red, green and blue intensity values associated with the line. Such
a “weighted” line may be mapped to the domain other line segments through the



                                                                                              276
transformations described above; if a line l1 shares a common range with l2 through some
mapping, the product of these lines is the line:
                                                 R1 + R2     G1 + G2     B1 + B2

                                                                2
                                                                     ,
                                                                            2
                                                                                                                       (VIII.13)



The notion of weights or “extra spatial” parameters provides a mechanism for representing
complex spatial metrics in simplified form. Consider the case of representing a point on a
plane p0 of distance d from a NURBS surface σ(u,v). (Figure VIII-6). The product of points in
a grammar with distance to some desired shape will be of interest in Chapter IX. The
functional description of the product <p × d(σ) > is a difficult in practice, defined as:

             u ,v
                        (
d ( p ) = Min S ( u, v ) − p                 )                                                                         (VIII.14)



This function typically cannot be solved in
closed form64. However, in developing
grammars in the space of the plane, we
may not need to know the complex
derivation of this distance functions, and
can map result back into the space of our                                 A. closest points on a         B. Distance field on

grammar simply as an “extra” variable.
We might draw on this variable as a
“labelling field”: on points defined on the
plane. Points on the plane will assume
the real-valued labelling associated with
the distance parameter of the point.

Other important geometric characteristics may be similarly addressed in grammatical
constructs. The gaussian curvature of a surface represents a similar real-valued function on
the (u,v) parametric space of the surface (Figure VIII-7).


Even higher order, vector based metrics may be addressed in similar fashion. The principal
directions associated with surface curvature may be of interest in grammatical applications.
The principal directions are R3 vector functions of the surface function S at the point S(up, vp)
(Section V.D.2). Since these vectors are in the tangent plane of S at p, they may be mapped
into the parametric space of S, by projecting these vectors into the dual space of the partial
derivate vector space (dS/du)* . The magnitudes of these projections define two R2
Cartesian product spaces associated with the parametric representation of S. With this
inverse mapping in place, we may consider establishing grammars in parametric space,
drawing on associated the R2         mapped principal direction vectors as elements of the

Discrete Topologies
While weights are naturally supported by manifold grammars, the adoption of labellings is not
so straight forward. Labellings present constructs in the discrete topology Z, a topological
structure quite different from the real valued spaces on which manifolds are normally defined.
Discrete topologies admit no notions of neighborhoods or boundaries, and all sets of discrete
elements are open sets. There is, for example, no notion of nearness between the qualities
of WOOD and STEEL. Thus we can not establish the differentiability among elements with
differing discrete values. We can, however, choose to establish some gradation on these
attributed objects, by establishing a product topology of the form <Z × R> and mapping
between discrete values and some real valued attribute. In our architectural labeling


                                                                                                    279
example, we can establish a material parameter stiffness, and map WOOD, STEEL, and
other attributed elements to this parameter accordingly. Alternatively, we can adopt the
approach proposed by Stiny, and treat the discrete value “axis” as defining disjoint sets of
shapes.


Closely related are topologies on natural numbers N ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, …} and integers I ∈ {…, -
3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, …}. The elements of these sets are likewise discrete. However, notions of
nearness, neighborhoods and boundaries may be established on these topologies. The
metric functions of distance may be defined similarly to that of real numbers: the distance

                                                         (5 − 2)
                                                                   2
between the integers 2 and 5 is of course 5 − 2 =                      = 3 . Other less intuitive distance

metrics can be defined on these elements. The “Manhattan geometry91”, is a topology on
horizontal and vertical lines in an integer space <I × I >. We can define a distance metric a
point a = (a1, a2) to b = (b1, b2) as d (a, b ) : I × I → R = a1 − b1 + a2 − b2 , corresponding to the

path taken by traversing between a and b exclusively along the streets of a grid, without
cutting corners. This distance metric satisfies the axioms for valid distance functions:
positivity, nondegeneracy, symmetry and triangle inequality7. Again, we can embed such
integer based topologies into corresponding real valued topologies through fairly obvious
mappings, although again differentiability can not be presumed.


Discrete topologies – and product topologies of real and discrete elements – have great
utility to generative systems. The production systems developed in computer science and
computational linguistics can be characterized as grammars on discrete symbols. Stiny and
Gips provide “a uniform characterization”84 of such systems.


Graphs
Graphs are one important such construct. A graph is a 2-tuple <N, E > of a set of discrete
elements or nodes (equivalently, vertices) N = {n1, n2, n3, . . . } and a set of edges E = { {ni1 ,
nj1}, {ni2 , nj2}, {ni3 , nj3}, …}, which associate pairs of vertices. Edges map N→ N although this
mapping is neither necessarily 1-1 nor onto, since a node may be joined by to more than one
other node by multiple edges. Again, it may be of use to embed a graph into some Euclidean
or other real valued space, by associating a node with a point space, resulting in a graph that
takes the form <(N × Rn) × E >. Graph edges, in turn, assume the form of curves joining the
embeddings of nodes as functions on Rn of the form (VIII.5). Indeed graph theory establishes


                                                                                                     280

edges that cross in space.


Grammars       on     graphs       may   be
developed            that           perform
transformation operations on node
and edge elements. Figure VIII-9
shows an example of a graph
grammar,           which        generates                     G1                         G2
subdivisions of triangles. The graph           Figure VIII-9: Graph grammar resulting i n the subdivision
                                                                      of triangles
on   the    left    hand    side    of   the
production rule is described by the set of nodes and edges:


G1 = {{n1,n2,n3} , { {n1,n2}, {n2,n3}, {n3,n1} } }


while the graph on the right side is represented by the graph:


G2 = {{n1,n2,n3,n4} , { {n1,n2}, {n2,n3}, {n3,n1} , {n1,n4} , {n2,n4} , {n3,n4} } }


The production rule G1 → G2 results in the insertion of 1 additional node and 3 additional
edges into a graph G. Parametric grammars may be considered to be graph grammars
embedding into Euclidean or other space.




                                                                                                     281
3.        Complexes
Graphs and graph grammars have direct
application      to      grammars         on       surface
assemblies, in forming the basis for topologies
of complexes. A complex is a topological space
constructed of vertices, edges, and polygons33.
Complexes are assemblies of n-simplexes,
basic       bounded,          connected        topological
elements of dimension n. A simplex of
                                                                          A. A surface complex
dimension n is bounded by a set of simplexes
of dimension n-1. Two n-simplexes join by
topological     identification     of     pairs     shared
boundary        elements.        Surface          (polygon)
elements combine by joining edges. Edges are
joined together to form boundaries of polygons
by topological identification of their boundary
vertices. Vertices (respectively edges) may be
identified with those of other equivalently
dimensioned elements.                                         B. Its constituent simplexes and identifications


This      description    of    spatial    elements      as
complexes does not describe the specifics of a
spatial object’s inhabitance of space. Rather, it
describes the connectedness of a spatial object
in terms of the connectedness of its constituent
elements. Complexes are a formulation of
spatial     objects     as    discrete    topologies     of
constituent components.

                                                                  C. Transformation by re-identification
In these terms, a surface assembly may be
                                                              Figure VIII-10: A complex as adjacency graph
considered a 5-tuple of the form <F, E, V, IE , IV > where F is a set of faces or polygons, E a
set of edges, V a set of vertices, and IE and IV are, respectively, identifications of edges and
vertices. Figure VIII-10A shows an example of a simple surface complex, comprised of two
sub-surfaces. The elements of this complex are:


                                                                                                           282
F = {s1 , s2 }
E = {e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6, e7 }
V = {a, b, c, d, f, g, h, i }
IE = {e2, e3}, {e4, e5}, {e6, e7}
IV = {a, b}, {c, d , f, g }, {h, i}


Transformation operations on spatial objects may be developed as graph grammars in the
topological space of these elements and their identifications, independent of their spatial
descriptions. Figure VIII-10C postulates such a transformation on the complex, where
substitutions occur in the identifications of the elements, of the form:


IE → IE’ :    {e2, e3}, {e4, e5}, {e6, e7} → {e2, e7}, {e3, e6}
IV → IV’ :    {a, b}, {c, d , f, g }, {h, i} → {a, g}, {b, f}, {c, i}, {d, h}



                              e2                           s1-1 ° s2 (e2) ∩ e1 ≠ ∅




                 s2                                                                  s1

                                Figure VIII-11: Mapping of shared boundaries


This representation of surface assemblies as complexes is compatible with their
organizations as manifolds. The graph representation of a complex may be mapped into the
organization of manifolds and their subspace boundaries. The identification of sub-elements
takes the form of embeddings. An edge e1 of surface element s1: U → R3 may be identified

with an edge e2 of s2:V → R3 if the mapping s1-1 ° s2 is at least C0 continuous and s1-1 ° s2 (e2)
∩ e1 ≠ ∅. The complex is Ck continuous at the edge between s1 and s2 if their charts are Ck
related at this shared boundary (Figure VIII-11). This geometric continuity28 describes the
differential order of shape continuity across element to element connections. Surfaces may


                                                                                              283
simply be touching or closed (order G0), tangent (G1) or curvature continuous (G2). Higher
order differential continuities are possible. In practical paper surface applications, gradations
of these qualities exist. Open seam conditions exist where edges are associated but do not
exactly touch. An edge may be only close to joining, connected but with large gaps, tape or
loosely fastened rivets or screws. An overlapping edge may partially constrain tangency or
curvature continuity, but allow a certain degree of deviation from true G1 or G2 connectivity.
Geometric continuity may be represented in the incidence graph as labellings on edge
identifications.


The connectedness of a complex may be represented in the discrete space of graphs whose
elements are these incidence coefficients33. We can draw on this simplified representation to
perform transformations on surface assemblies. The triangle subdivision grammar shown in
Figure VIII-9 presents one such example. This representation of this operation on the
complex graph presents a vast simplification of the problem space. Of course, this
representation hides all detail of how the transformation affects the actual embedding of the
triangle assembly in space. If, as is likely, this knowledge is important to decision making by
the grammar, we will again need to map spatial metrics back into the graph space, or
conduct our grammar in the product space of the embedded graph with other spatial
representations of the complex’s constituent elements.



C.      SUMMARY
This chapter has established a formal basis for the development of shape grammars of
surface assemblies. This structuring views shapes as real, differentiable functions operating
in Cartesian product spaces of the form <Rn × Rm>. Shape boundaries are similarly described
as sub-manifolds of the form <Rn-1 × Rn>, embedded in the parametric space of the shape.
The important algebraic foundations of the shape grammar formalism, including notions of
shape – part relations, Boolean algebras on shapes, and shape labellings and weights, were
developed through this manifold representation.


The structuring of manifolds provides the potential for grammar operations on complicated
spatial objects, such as our paper surface assemblies, to be conducted in spaces
representing alternative, simplified, representations of these objects, while allowing the full
richness of the objects’ spatial behaviors to be referenced by the grammar.

IX.          GENERATIVE RATIONALIZATION

This chapter presents several examples of grammars that have been applied on Gehry
projects or are currently under development. In general, these applications are directed
toward rationalization of the surface forms to address specific constructibility requirements.
The strategies taken in this chapter differ depending on the application and the specific
requirements of the surface fabrication strategy. However, some general characterizations of
these approaches may be made.


•     A pre-rationalized “ideal surface form” – perhaps the product of digitized physical models-
      is admitted as the input shape for rationalization operations.


•     Surface elements and their boundary forms serve as the elements of the grammar.
      These surface elements are formally described as parametric mapping functions in <R2 ×
      R3> space. The characteristics of this differentiable mapping function are specific to the
      constructibility problem under consideration. Examples include the constrained curvature,
      developable and materials based surface representations presented in Chapters VI and
      VII.


•     The surface manifold is considered both a “micro” representation of the surface elements
      and a “macro” scale perspective of the assembly’s organization as a whole. To simplify
      operations, grammars are typically conducted at least partially in the parametric space of
      the surface elements, drawing on Euclidean characteristics of this space, and the
      corresponding reduction of the space’s dimensional order. Macro level operations are
      often conducted on the graph of boundary element identifications.


•     Shape metrics and other heuristics from the 3-dimensional configuration are mapped
      onto these representations as labellings on grammar elements. These metrics provide
      the grammar with heuristics to assess the constructibility of assembly.


•     The grammars perform substitution operations on sheet boundaries and other features in
      parametric space, and operations such as splitting or insertion of faces in the graph of the




                                                                                              285
     surface complex. Substitution operations are performed toward the goal of satisfying
     constructibility conditions of the assembly.



A.      GENERATIVE APPLICATIONS ON THE EXPERIENCE MUSIC PROJECT
The genesis of these applications was a series of rationalization studies conducted during
design development on the Experience Music Project. Section VI.2 described the macro
scale constrained gaussian curvature approach taken to rationalizing EMP’s form. Additional
rationalization operations were conducted both at a global scale as well as on the localized
configuration of sheets during shop drawing generation. Automation efforts were conducted
in parallel with the manual operations.

1.      Design Development Applications
Initial design development rationalization studies were pursued over the period between
March and May of 1997. The approach described in this section is based on an assumption
that surface forms of any curvature can be constructed from flat sheets, deformed within
some limited range, presuming that the dimensions of the surface sheets are varied in
response to the surface curvature. Breaks in tangency between sheets accommodate some
degree of curvature in the macro scale surface form. Decreasing the size of panels should
increase the number of these tangency breaks, allowing greater degrees of curvature to be
accommodated.


The design surface (Figure IX-1A) was initially approximated as a fine grained, rectangular
grating33 (Figure IX-1B). This regularized, integer space parameterization provided an
efficient spatial construct on which to perform the grammar operations. The goal of the
grammar was to determine a configuration of surface regions whose deviation from a plane
was within a predetermined tolerance.




                                                                                        286

                         Figure IX-1: Subdivision grammar metrics (EMP)


The algorithms begin by determining a best fit plane to the surface in a given rectangular
region. Surface normals approximated for each facet neighboring a vertex are summed and
normalized to provide a localized approximation of the surface normal at the vertex (Figure
IX-1C). These localized surface normals are in turn summed over the rectangular region to
determine an average surface normal for the region. The vertices in the region are then
projected onto this vector. The span of these projected points provides a measure of the
planarity of the surface region. If this deviation from the average plane on the surface region
is within a specified tolerance, the region is considered to be acceptably planar. If not, a
recursive subdivision is conducted on the region.

Subdivision strategies for surface approximation have
significant    attention    in     the     computer       science
community. Analogues are found in shape grammar
literature. The point of departure for these grammars is
                                                                    Figure IX-2: Base Mughul grammar
provided by the Mughul garden grammar86. The basic                            production rule
production rule of the Mughul grammar subdivides a square into 4 smaller squares. This
operation may be recursively re-applied to generate localized, arbitrarily small square regions
of the space.


This production rule can be tailored to perform
subdivisions     directed        towards     satisfying
localized conformity conditions. Hokoda adopts
this approach in image tiling applications58. His
approach (Figure IX-4) performs a histogram
on pixel brightness across a region of an
image. The operation is performed in the I2
integer pixel space of an image of size 2i. If
the values vary by greater than some
threshold, a bi-directional subdivision of the
image region according to the rule in Figure
IX-2 is performed. The subdivision is repeated
recursively     until   a   specified       histogram          Figure IX-3: Image subdivision using a
                                                                          histogram metric
threshold is encountered. The recursion is
guaranteed to terminate, since the limit of recursion is one pixel, whose internal variation is
guaranteed to be zero. This recursion will be guaranteed to terminate if the threshold
functions tends toward zero as region size decreases. However, this is true for many
interesting spatial metrics.


This subdivision strategy can be applied to any two dimensional rectangular grating R2 or I2
that admits a scalar metric field. An initial application of this approach to curved surface
rationalization is shown in Figure IX-4A. This example correctly identifies flat regions of
varying size, depending on the local surface curvature. However, there are limitations to this
initial result. The layout is inefficient, producing more subdivisions than necessary. If a region
under consideration only one small part out of plane, the algorithm will subdivide the region


                                                                                                        288
into four sub-regions, where a subdivision into two might be sufficient. The algorithm also
produces a relatively predictable pattern of equal sized regions with a very visible pattern of
tessellation.

This simple subdivision algorithm can be improved on in a variety of ways. The most obvious
means for improving the efficiency of the subdivision is to search for some best flat
subregion, rather than simply splitting the region in the middle. The grammar shown in Figure
IX-4B and Figure IX-5B divides the regions in half instead of quarters. At each step in the
recursion, the grammar steps across the region in both horizontal and vertical directions,
attempting to find a largest region with acceptable metrics. If such a region is found, the
algorithm terminates on this valid subregion and recurses on the remainder of the initial
region. A third approach is shown in Figure IX-4C and Figure IX-5C shows an additional
modification, where the subdivision is not limited to two regions, but also allows a subdivision
into 3 parts if an interior region is the largest acceptable region. This result provides the most
optimal layout of regions in the series, and additionally generated random patterning qualities
that were of interest to the project designers. These studies demonstrated the potential of
subdivision grammars to addressing certain constructibility issues on surfaces, and
additionally showed that the approach could be tailored to respond to qualities of design.

During contract document preparation, the subdivision approach was modified to remove the
necessity for a polygonized grating, and operated directly in the parametric space of the
Bézier patch surface representation. Surface regions were defined on the basis of
parametric coordinates along an isoparametric curve. However, planar cuts were required by


                                                                                      290
the fabricator, so a best fit normal plane was
defined between the edge vertices of an
isoparametric curve, and an intersection was
created between this plane and the surface.
The fabricator imposed additional constraints,
limiting the size of a panel and face sheet to
maximum dimensions of 10’ x 15’ and
maximum square area of 100 square feet for
                                                        Figure IX-6: Basic parametric subdivision

sheets based on available material sizes. The
subdivision terminates at acceptable panel
size, then is re-run on the resulting panels to
define the face sheets. Figure IX-7 shows the
results as they appeared on the design
development package of the project.


Additional generative studies were conducted
at the face sheet level. These studies
attempted to optimize the layout of face
sheets on an individual panel, on the basis of         Figure IX-7: subdivision grammar applied to
available material sizes. The production rules              EMP design development models

generating the face sheet configurations
shown in Figure IX-8 represent a slight modification of those in Figure IX-5. In these
examples, the subdivision grammar splits the panel along a line parallel to one of the panel
edges, offset at a distance defined by the width of the available surface material. If the length
of the resulting edge piece is greater than the length of the available material, the edge piece
is further split into pieces of appropriate length. The algorithm is then recursively applied to
the remainder of the panel. The algorithm terminates when the remaining region is smaller
than the dimensions of the surface material. Each of the four region edges are successively
offset at each level of the recursion. The result is a full traversal of the set of all possible face
sheet configurations for the given panel dimensions and material sheet size.

2.    Construction Documentation and Shop Drawing Phase Applications
The applications of rationalizing grammars described above provided substantial saving of
effort for the CAD modeling team during contract document preparations. However, during
constriction document and shop drawing phases, the set of rules imposed by the fabricator
on the paneling system organization was substantially extended. These additional
constraints resulted in requirements that could not be addressed by a completely automated
approach.


The geometric complexity of the final cladding system are largely a product of the project’s
fast track schedule. The design of the rib and concrete shell structural system was finalized
before details of the cladding system were known. Once the cladding system was designed,
its organization had to be integrated with the already designed structural system
organization. At the same time, design considerations regarding the pattern of panels on the




                                                                                         294
surface had to be addressed. The complexity
of the cladding system organization is
directly related to its response to these
design and performance requirements.


The fabricator designed the cladding system
using conventional pre-fabricated cladding
system detailing, radically modified to support
the curved project geometry. The decision
was made to pre-fabricate the surface as
                                                   Figure IX-10: Pipe routing through interstitial
panelized system, rather than construct the
                                                                      space
surface in the field. The panels are formed
as a box configuration of planar, CNC cut fins
that respond to the curvature of the CATIA
surface model. Face sheets of the finish
metal were fastened to the tops of these fins.


The strategy for fastening these panels to the
structural frame relied on a modified detail
from conventional cladding systems, called
the “rock & roll” connection. A slot in the fins
at the bottom edge of each panel is inserted
into a ball connector on a metal extrusion.
                                                           Figure IX-11: Panel framing
The panel is lowered onto the ball connector,
then rotated about the connector until the top edge of the panel can be seated into the lower
edge of the next extrusion above. The panel is then fastened to the top connector along its
top edge. This strategy requires fasteners only at the top, free edge of the panel, removing
the necessity for fasteners to be added at the lower edge, where the previously installed
lower panel would prohibit access.


This connection requires a straight, linear extrusion along the bottom edge of each panel. On
EMP, this extrusion is supported by a system of segmented tubes, which span between the
ribs of the structural system. The major design challenge of the system became fitting the
system of tubes into the small interstitial space between the design surface and the already


                                                                                                295
existing geometry of the structural rib and concrete shell. Each tube is initially viewed as a
planar intersection with the surface, offset a pre-determined distance inward from the
surface. The tube curve is then segmented into straight runs that “bounce” between pre-
determined offsets from the finish surface and the concrete shell (Figure IX-10). Structural
requirements imposed numerous additional geometric rules on the layout of the tube system.
At the same time, the tube layout had substantial implications on the surface pattern, since
the panel connection detail required a vertical panel break at each kink in the tube.


The fabricator provided an extensive set of rules in writing to the design team, which
specified the geometric requirements of each panel system element. On the basis of these
rules, a procedure for the layout of tubes and panel edge locations was established. These
geometric rules can be considered a grammar on the organization of the elements:
1.     First, a set of planar curves representing the tube locations and corresponding
       horizontal panel breaks are constructed on the surface.
2.     Next, geometric operations are performed to bounce the tube center line between the
       offsets defining the interstitial space.
3.     The kink locations are projected back on to the surface, to define the vertical panel
       breaks at the panel jambs. This defines regions on the surface, spanning vertically
       from tube to tube, and horizontally between tube kinks.
4.     Additional horizontal panel breaks are added if the horizontal distance of the region is
       longer than can be accommodated by a single panel.
5.     Finally, face sheets are laid out on each panel, through rules on face sheets similar to
       those presented in the previous section.


Figure IX-17 provides a listing of the geometric rules provided by the fabricator to the design
team. The elements of the grammar are shown schematically in Figure IX-12, while Figure
IX-13 through Figure IX-16 show the organization of the resulting system elements on
Element 7 of the project.

Much of the instantiation of these rules on the final project documentation was performed
through manual operations, due to the geometric complexity of the problem and the
limitations of geometric programming tools available at the time. However, elements of the
problem were addressed through automation. The instantiation of face sheets described in
rule 5 was conducted on some elements of the building using the subdivision strategy shown
in Figure IX-8. Additional automation of the pedestal geometry was achieved.


Zahner’s shop was able to substantially automate the fabrication of panel components.
Zahner’s automated panel layout program (ZAPLA), written in the parametric modeler PRO-
ENGINEER, generated panel component geometry from the surface model and panel and
face sheet boundaries provided by the architectural team. Shop tickets were generated for all
components of the panel (Figure IX-18). Flattened profiles for each CNC cut element were
also generated by the program.

B.      MATERIALS BASED RATIONALIZATION
In this final section, discussion turns to the development of grammars on the basis of the
materials simulation constructs developed in Chapter VII. In this section, the constructs
developed to support materials based modeling of sheet materials will be re-directed toward
applications of surface rationalization.


The materials modeling approach is well suited to applications of grammars on manifolds
developed in Chapter VIII.B. We direct this application to problems where a desired surface
form – provided by digitizing of schematic design physical models – is rationalized into
constructible by assemblies of material sheets. Such a generative strategy will require the
definition of the following components:


1.      A notion of the space in which shapes, elements and transformation are defined,
2.      A set of elements, with a topology of element-part relationships defined on these
        elements,
3.      A set of possible transformations on these elements, and shapes developed as
        compositions of elements.


To this set of conditions, we will add the following to direct the definition of grammars toward
the rationalization activities:


4.      A goal toward the satisfaction of which shape transformations are directed,
5.      A set of heuristics measuring of the fitness of produced shapes toward satisfaction of
        the goal.

1.      Spaces and Elements
In   Euclidean grammars, the notion of a space in which elements are defined and
transformations occur is often assumed with little discussion. This space provides the
“playing field” on which grammars occur, and contributes implicitly to the specification of valid
elements of the grammar. The set of elements in Euclidean space grammars are the valid
Euclidean elements of the space: points, lines, and bounded planar regions in Euclidean 2-
space, with the inclusion of bounded volumes in R3.




                                                                                             303
In the formalism of grammars on manifolds developed in the previous chapter, the structuring
of a pre-defined space of operation is no longer presumed, and the distinction between this
presumed space and the elements inhabiting this space is no longer clearly defined. An
element is defined as a function, mapping coordinates (and functions on these coordinates)
between and intrinsic, parametric space and an extrinsic, containing space. The space of an
element is determined by the partly by the structuring the intrinsic and extrinsic spaces, and
through the mapping function defined by the element occurring in the product space of the
intrinsic and extrinsic spaces. In turn, this structuring provides the basis space for the
definition of boundary and other elements, defined in the parametric space of the containing
element.


Several such interrelated manifold structures were presented in the development of the
materials modeling formulation; all of these - individually and in combination - are candidates
for grammatical constructions:


•   Features of the surface were defined as 1-dimensional elements within the R2 parametric
    space of the surface. The boundary descriptions of the sheet – described as a closed set
    of edges connected at their boundary vertices – were the most important such features
    (Figure IX-19A). As this discussion of materials based grammars progresses, additional
    features defined in the parametric space of the surface will be presented.


•   An edge graph is constructed on the basis of these sheet features. This edge graph
    resulted from a processing of the sheet features, to identify intersections of features,
    define the interior and exterior regions of the sheet, and characterize parts of features in
    terms of their relations to the sheet’s interior and exterior (Figure IX-19B). The graph was
    defined through 0-dimensional vertices and 1-dimensional edges. The organization of
    sheet features resulted directly in the construction of the edge graph.


•   The edge graph as discretized triangulations of a region of R2 parametric space. These
    surfaces are embedded in R3 world space through the <R2 × R3> mapping function
    φt : u → x (Figure IX-19D).




                                                                                            304

The materials modeling formalism developed in Chapter VII considered the construction and
behavior of shapes formed from single sheets. As we move toward constructs supporting
assemblies of such elements, representations of surface complexes developed in Section

                                                                                       305
VIII.B.3 will be developed on top of the representation of sheets. The structuring of sheet
complexes – including identifications of boundary edges and vertices – will provide an
additional framework on which transformational operations may be defined. Operations on
the complex of sheets embedded in R3 will be undertaken in the graph representation of the
complex. Examples of such operations might include splitting sheets – replacing sheet
elements with 2 or more elements, and inserting of deleting of sheets. Similarly, we can
modify the assembly by altering identifications between sheets boundary elements,
introducing or removing continuity between sheet elements.

These elements of the formulation do not
necessarily represent shapes themselves, but
structures by which shapes may be defined.
As defined in the grammar formalism, shapes
are entities composed of elements. Shape
types may be defined as pre-determined
configurations of elements. For example, we
are free to define a class of rectangles (Figure
IX-20, and Section IX.B.6 below), and define
                                                    Figure IX-20: A construction of rectangular
grammars,     operations     and    assemblies                 sheets and springs
constructed on this class of elements, founded
on the constructs defined above.

2.     Sheet Features
In the context of this discussion, a feature is a shape, constructed in the parametric space of
a sheet, with implications on the sheet’s topology or behavior. Features represent potential
elements in a vocabulary of sheet based grammars. So far, discussions of features have
focused on boundary elements of the sheet, specifically linear edges joined at their boundary
vertices.


Obviously, the configuration of a sheet’s boundary elements has implications on the
flattened, parametric space shape of the sheet. The effects of a sheet’s boundary on the
potential configurations of a sheet in space are perhaps more subtle. Obviously, a change in
the flattened shape of a sheet will necessarily change its configuration in space. However, it
is worth noting that adding material to (removing material from) a sheet at its boundary will



                                                                                             306
increase (decrease) the local stiffness of the sheet, resulting in changes to the flexibility to
which the sheet can assume certain configurations.


There is a potentially large variation of sheet configurations purely on the basis of boundary
elements. Figure IX-21 shows some of these potential variations. Sheets can have internal
boundaries, producing holes in the sheet, as in Figure IX-21A. A sheet’s boundary elements
can potentially result in self-intersections (Figure IX-21B). The arrangement of boundary
elements can result in non-connected regions of parametric space, technically violating the
precise definition of a manifold (Figure IX-21C). Multiple boundaries may partially intersect,
resulting in configurations such as in (Figure IX-21D).

            C. Non-connected sheet                 D. Sheet with multiple intersecting boundaries

                                                                                                   307
A subtle consideration is found in these various examples: rules must be established to
define the ways in which multiple closed or intersecting boundaries interact. The region of
parametric space defined by multiple boundaries may be defined as the union of their
regions as individuals (as in Figure IX-21B), as their difference (Figure IX-21A), or through
some other scheme (Figure IX-21D). These rule definitions may be considered potential
elements of a grammar of sheets.


Other features are evident in the firm’s paper schematic design models, which have
implications on the behavior of sheets’ configurations in space. Cuts, tears, creases and
folds are all potential manipulations of the sheets configurations, that are manifested in the
flattened, parametric space of the sheets. The dodges and inserts described in textile design
are also possible design elements. This section discusses their resolution in the sheet
material modeling approach, and in generative applications based on this approach.


A     cut       in     the     flattened
representation of a sheet is
has an interesting behavior,
in    that      it    results      in    a
discontinuity         of     the     sheet
without actually affecting the
sheet’s 2-dimensional shape.
We can represent this feature
                                                                 A. Before cut insertion
as a simple line in the feature
representation of the surface.
By itself, this feature insertion
has    little        impact     on      the
triangulation of the sheet’s
region, since it does not
directly impact the boundary
of the shape. In order for the
feature to act as a cut, it is in                                 B. After cut insertion

vertices along the line of the feature in 2-space must be disrupted. In the modeling


                                                                                                           308
application, this is undertaken by associating edges and vertices produced along the cut with
the feature, then “unzipping” the triangulation of these edges and vertices, inserting duplicate
edges and vertices, and repairing the relationships between edges, vertices and triangular
polygons to produce the necessary additional free edges and vertices while maintaining the
integrity of the mesh.


Topologically, the cut is a so-called “non-manifold” feature, whose behavior as an edge,
embedded in a region of R2 space, violates the simple structuring of 1-dimensional elements
bounding 2-dimensional regions. A full non-manifold representation of design spaces is
beyond the scope of this work, but the behavior can be accommodated by heuristic
operations on the triangulation as described above, and shown in Figure IX-22. Again, we
draw on the simplifications provided by different representations of the problem: from the
perspective of a grammar, we may consider this non-manifold behavior of the edge as simply
a CUT labelling in the feature space of the problem, and delegate the impact of this feature
on the sheet’s topology to the triangulation complex.


Dodges are areas where material is cut from the sheet, and the edges of the cut are fastened
together. This has the effect of locally shrinking the material in the region of the dodge.
Inserts are locations where a cut is made, and material is inserted into the cut., locally
stretching the sheet. Both of these actions have implications on the topology of the sheet,
and on the complex of the triangulation.


Figure IX-23 shows the operations of dodge insertion. A new behavior on linear parametric
features is developed, where the line feature defines a symmetric split line. The split line
feature traces two pairs of edge elements, each pair connected by a symmetrically placed
point off the line (Figure IX-23B).
One of the modes of behavior of this feature is simply to split the mesh open (Figure IX-23C).
This splitting functionality must guarantee that edge generation is symmetric across the
edge, so that distortion of triangles is not introduced. Figure IX-23C shows the mesh
generation across the split feature. Pairings of mesh vertices are indicated with in dashed
cyan line. Note that the edge graph must translate intersections of the split feature
boundaries to its opposite edge, to again insure compatibility of edge identification without
triangle distortion. Figure IX-23E shows the results of the dodge insertion on the 3-D sheet.




                                                                                            309
The dodge feature must
next adjust the mesh to
weld     the       edges    of    the
feature together. This is
accomplished by edge and
vertex identification (Section
VIII.B.3)      Opposing         edges
and vertices of the mesh are
                                         A                        B
joined         together.         This
translation          results       in
distortion of the associated
triangles      (Figure     IX-23C),
and of the embedded sheet
in     R3.     Note      that     this
distortion is enacted only on
the R3 configuration only,
since we wish to preserve                C                         D
the original triangle shapes
in the materials simulation.
Thus,        the    locations      of
vertices in R2 is unaltered
and remains that shown in
Figure IX-23C, while their
locations in R3 are moved to
join the opposing vertices                   E                        F

(Figure IX-23D and F). This
necessarily induces stress
on the affected triangles,
whose shapes in the time
based          simulation         are
stretched relative to their
reference configurations in
R2.      This       distortion      is       G

results in principally out of plane
deformation of the entire mesh.
Figure IX-23G shows the resolution
of the forces induced by the dodge
insertion, as the simulation is run
toward   stability.   Note    that    the
dodge    insertion    approach       must   A                                   B
address conditions where one leg
of the dodge is longer than another,
and a free portion remains after the
edge identification occurs.


Insert features (Figure IX-24) are
conceptually     similar.     However,
instead of material being removed           C                                   D
symmetrically     from      the   mesh,
symmetric additions of material
must occur along the feature edges
(Figure IX-24B). In practice, this is
more difficult than material removal,
since the insertion would require                            E

overlapping of material in the flat
space of the sheet, violating the
topology of the sheet as a single,
bounded region of Euclidean 2-
space, and is difficult for the
meshing algorithm to resolve. This
problem can be resolved by treating
the additions as separate sheets in
                                                             F.

edges of the sheet feature (Figure IX-24C-D). This can introduce additional complexities,
since the geometry of the insert will tend to product thin triangles, which create numerical
problems for the material solver.
In practice, insert creation has been addressed by constraining inserts to occur only across
boundaries between separate sheets. Insert placement is achieved by splitting the sheet into
two separate sheets, and identifying edges of the sheets in space. This limits insert creation
to configurations which completely traverse the sheet boundaries.


Two examples of feature behavior have been described so far: features which split the
surface complex, generating a surface discontinuity between pairs of edges across the
feature, and features which “weld” the edges generated by the feature. We can identify a few
additional behaviors of interest. The feature can create a “hinge” configuration between
edges across the feature. In the case of the simple, linear feature, this is simply achieved, by
disabling the bending force on edges of the triangulation associated with the feature. This
allows the simulation to proceed without imposing energy penalties on out of plane
configurations between neighboring triangles across the feature.


Similarly, we will be interested in features that join neighboring regions of material,
preserving tangency of the associated material regions across the feature. In the case of the
linear feature, this is the trivial case: the feature has no behavior other than to create a line in
the triangulation at the feature. In the case of dodges and inserts, we simply enable the
bending energy formulation across the newly identified edges of the triangulation.


It is also advantageous to have a feature behavior that binds neighboring mesh regions in
“proximal” continuity, where the edges are attracted to one another but are not necessarily
constrained to meet exactly. This can be achieved in the material simulation by joining
identified vertices across the feature with a spring of some selected stiffness. This is
practically advantageous, since introducing continuity instantaneously between neighboring
triangles can introduce large scale distortions of triangle configurations and the underlying
energy function, resulting in instability of the material solution. The attractor behavior allows
us to slowly increase the continuity of the mesh, to the point where full continuity can be
numerically achieved.




                                                                                               312
These different feature types correspond roughly to the order of geometric continuity28 of the
surface at the feature, and the order of differentiability of the manifold charts across the
feature. We may categorize these features as follows:


•   Discontinuous – the surface is split across the feature
•   Proximally continuous – attractor forces are introduced between identified vertices
•   G0 continuity – vertex and edge identification occurs across the feature
•   G1 continuity – bending forces are observed on neighboring triangles across the feature


A couple of caveats are appropriate regarding this categorization. First, the notion of G1
tangency of the manifold is only approximate, since the mesh solution is linearized by the
discretization of the surface manifold into triangles. In actuality, the triangles are of course
not tangent at all, but rather guided toward tangency as the limit of the energy formulation.
As triangle size is reduced, the energy function converges in fact toward G2 geometric
continuity where the surface curvature varies smoothly over the manifold. Second, we note
in passing that the notion of proximally continuous conditions introduced by the attractor
forces represent a smooth continuum between completely discontinuous – where the spring
stiffness is 0 – to G0 continuity, where the spring stiffness is infinite.

Two examples of feature shape – linear and split line - have been described and
implemented in the solver. The symmetry of these shapes guarantee that the length along
the edges of both sides of the feature are guaranteed, and that the impact of intersections
with other features can be easily transferred to opposing edges. These characteristics are
critical to guarantee edge identification without introducing undesirable deformations of the
mesh, and simplify the process of creating opposing triangle edges of equal length.


These examples are of course only examples of a larger set of desirable shapes and
associated geometric constructs which exhibit these characteristics (Figure IX-25). In
particular, the spit edge configuration, while providing the useful ability to curve the edge
shape in parametric space – and thereby introduce controlled deformations of the resulting
configuration in R3 – creates this curvature only at its vertices. This results in a curvature
discontinuity of the feature at these points. Smoother shapes such as arc and curves (Figure
IX-25 C&D) would provide a smoother curvature variation, resulting in smoother variations of
the surface complex as it is pulled into shape in R3. The potential exists for other shapes


                                                                                            313
whose length equivalencies are guaranteed by other means, including rotational symmetry

3.     Fitness Heuristics and Goals
Loosely stated, the goal of the generative rationalization approach is to best approximate an
ideal design surface with an assembly of sheets, whose geometric behavior correctly
anticipates that of actual of actual construction materials. Additional desired behaviors may
be anticipated. The resulting rationalized assembly should correctly interpret intentional
features in the design model, including sheet boundaries, creases and continuity breaks (we
recognize that such features may appear in the design model, but may not be intended in the
final form). Other qualities, dictated by constructibility requirements, may be desired in the
generated assembly as well. The fabrication process may dictate maximum or minimum
sheet dimensions, or straight sheet edges. Our rationalization scheme should be able to
incorporate such requirements, either as part of the schema of sheet shapes, or as goals of
the generative process.



                                                                                          316
In order to determine fitness of a sheet assembly to these goals, we establish two types of
metrics on the shape:


    Metrics on the shape of the assembly, relative to design surfaces
    Metrics of intrinsic and extrinsic properties of the shape relative to constructibility
    requirements


In our rationalization application, such metrics
have    application   as   weights   or,     more
appropriately, weight fields, on features in
parametric space, as discussed in Section
VIII.B.2 above.


The most elemental metric of assembly fitness
is distance between a design surface and the
assembly. If the produced assembly is close to
the design surface within some minimal
                                                      Figure IX-28:Distance metric on sheet
tolerance at all points, then the generated
assembly is a successful approximation of the design surface. Larger, non-trivial deviations
between design and resulting surfaces may be accepted as part of the rationalization
process; in these circumstances other heuristics such as surface smoothness may come into
play. Distance is measured between each vertex of each sheet in the assembly.                 The
distance between a vertex and each element of the design surface is computed; the closest
of these distances is deemed the correct measure of the distance function. This computed
distance to the closest design object is also used as the input to the attractor force
computation. Distances between vertices locations in R3 and design elements are computed
based on the design element type. For example, the distance between a vertex v and a
sphere centered at c of radius r is simply
d = |v - c| - r                                                                           (IX.1)


The distance between a vertex and Bézier or NURBS surfaces are computed by determining
the point on the surface whose surface normal passes through the vertex64. Similar
computations between points in R3 and Euclidean elements are well documented13.




                                                                                              317
The    attractor    force        is     the    simulated
approximation of fastening strategies between
sheet elements and an underlying substrate or
sub-framing    system.      An        inordinately   large
attractor force between sheets and design
elements    can    guarantee           close   distances
between input and generated elements, as the
mesh is “squashed” down onto the surface.
However, such large scale forces will both
                                                                 Figure IX-29:Strain map
result in unrealistic simulation results, since the
force will exceed the capabilities of real fasteners, and will overwhelm the computed internal
forces of the sheet material, producing unrealistic deformations of the surface material. To
address this condition as a simulation heuristic, we may of course limit the attractor force to
some limit guided by an understanding of the capabilities of fastening elements.


We may also check the assembly for realistic configurations by analyzing the internal strain
of the sheet elements. A heuristic is used in the simulator that checks relative lengths of
triangle edges against the undeformed length of the sheet in its flattened reference
configuration in parametric space. A readout is produced graphically of this relative
deformation; these results are available as a heuristic to be used by the generative scheme.


Surface curvature is another key metric of the shape of a surface. It was established in
Section V.D.2 that the gaussian curvature map of a surface is sufficient to fully describe its
shape. Hence, equivalence of gaussian curvature between a design shape and a resulting
rationalized shape dictates that these two representations have the same shape, and we
may draw on this relative measure of localized gaussian curvature as a metric of a
rationalized complex in representing a design shape. Of course, the rationalization
operations will generally be intended to reduce surface curvature in the rationalized surface
relative to the design surfaces, but we will still find this relative metric of use in describing the
correspondence of the resulting surface relative to its pre-rationalized form.


Computation of gaussian curvature on the design shapes is achieved as described in Section
V.D. The gaussian curvature of a sphere is trivially 1/r2, and invariant over the sphere. The


                                                                                                318
localized curvature of a Bézier surface is derived from the 1st and 2nd derivatives of the
mapping function in (V.62).


Determination of the gaussian curvature of the
discretized mesh is more problematic, since the
triangulation is only C0 continuous at triangle edges,
hence the 1st and 2nd derivatives of the surface are
unavailable at the triangle boundaries. Various
techniques have been described for approximating
the gaussian curvature and principal directions on a
mesh22,37         56,
                         . The simplest and most robust
approximates the curvature at a vertex P0 as:                         P

the triangulation will be drawn to impose global curvature on the surface complex.

4.       Initial Shape
A grammar requires an initial shape I as the
starting point of transformations operations.
In   the    materials      based    rationalization
approach, the input shape is a starting
complex of one sheet, best aligned with the
design surfaces by attraction forces. The
materials simulator is robust in its ability to
align sheet materials with design surfaces,
regardless of the starting location of the
sheet.     In    the   current   version   of   the          User placed sheet, design surface
generative solver, the initial sheet’s shape
and location is provided by user input. This
aligned shape – produced by running the
materials       solution   toward   convergence,
provides the initial shape I of the grammar.


Improved        strategies   are    possible    for
providing computationally generated an
input shapes with closer affinity to the
design surface. There has been substantial            Figure IX-31: Input shape to grammar, after initial
                                                                convergence of the simulator
research in texture mapping applications to
provide flattened meshes that minimize distortion of the shape17, 22, 30, 75, 92. This approach has
also been targeted toward design applications93. Several of these approaches apply physics
and / or energy based solutions to minimize distortion in these flattened triangulations. These
approach are similar to the materials modeling approach presented in this thesis, but applied
“in reverse” to provide a mapping function of the form R3 → R2. The R3 triangulation is initially
flattened into R2, in a topologically consistent (non-self intersecting or overlapping) manner.
Energy penalties are determined for deformations of the R3 triangles in R2. An energy
minimizing search is run, providing a best fit configuration of the parametric space
triangulation, and determining (u, v) coordinates for the vertices of the mesh. In our
application, this now parameterized mesh could then be applied to the design surface as a
starting point for the sheet in R3. The simulation can then be run to convergence, providing
the initial shape of the starting sheet.


                                                                                                     320
5.     Transformations
Chapter VIII provided the framework for grammars on manifolds, and established the basis
for conducting generative operations on surface complexes. Details for applying this
framework to the rationalization of surfaces have been described in this chapter. With this
framework in hand, we are provided the ability to perform generative rationalization of sheet
assemblies, in the parametric space of the sheets, and in the graph of the sheet complex,
without incurring the complexity of performing operations on the embedded, curved surfaces
themselves.


Figure IX-32 summarizes this strategy. The parametric space assembly of sheet boundaries
and features in Figure IX-32A is mapped into R3 through the material deformation function,
resulting in the sheet configuration of Figure IX-32B. Fitness heuristics are determined on
the sheets configuration in R3 (Figure IX-32C). These heuristics are mapped back into the
parametric / feature space through the inverse mapping function F-1 (Figure IX-32D), and
serve as a “weight field” on features in parametric space. Production rules transform the
shape composed of the parametric space features (Figure IX-32E), resulting in changes to
the sheet boundary or other topological characteristics of the sheet. The transformed sheet is
again mapped back into world space (Figure IX-32F) by the mapping function, solved over
the simulation time. The simulation is allowed to converge to steady state after each
production rule application. Once convergence is detected, the next production rule of the
grammar is fired.


The cycle is repeated until the sheet configuration has satisfied the performance
requirements, at which point the weight field – now within satisfactory ranges - results in
terminal shapes of the grammar, and the iterations terminate.


With this framework and strategy in place, the unbounded range of shapes in Euclidean 2-
space, and production rules constructed on these shapes, are available for application to
surface rationalization. In the subsequent sections of this thesis, a few example applications
are explored.

                        Figure IX-33: Surface patterns of rectangular sheets


Construction assemblies of rectangular sheets represent a broad category of interest in
Gehry projects.    Many projects have been clad with sheet elements of approximately
rectangular elements. The Experience Music Museum, Guggenheim Bilbao, Disney Concert
Hall and Weatherhead projects are examples. Frequently, multiple cladding subsystems on
a project have this property, including back panel and cladding elements, and possibly other
elements as well (insulation, waterproof barrier, etc.). This section describes a materials
simulation based grammar of rectangular sheet elements, their possible organizations and
rationalization through variation of sheet sizes.




                                                                                            323
In the grammars that we develop, rectangles
will represent the base shape of all grammar
production rules. A rectangle is, of course, a
region of R2 bounded by four linear features,
two running horizontally, two vertically. We
may thus define a rectangle as the 4-tuple of
lines < l1, l2, l3, l4 >, where l1 and l2 are
horizontally oriented and l3 and l4 are                       Base rectangle shape and boundary features
                                                                              Figure IX-35
vertical. The horizontal and vertical pairs of
features          are     joined       by       topological
identification of their end points. We may define the linear features as parametric functions
on their end points:


l1 = F ( p1, p2 ) = p1 + t1 ( p2 − p1 ) | t1 ∈ ( 0,1)
l 2 = F ( p3 , p4 ) = p3 + t 2 ( p4 − p3 ) | t 2 ∈ ( 0,1)
                                                                                                    (IX.4)
l 3 = F ( p1, p3 ) = p1 + t3 ( p3 − p1 ) | t3 ∈ ( 0,1)
l 4 = F ( p2 , p4 ) = p2 + t 4 ( p4 − p2 ) | t 4 ∈ ( 0,1)


If we limit the grammars under consideration to those on orthogonally oriented rectangles,
we may fully describe the instantiation of the rectangle in parametric space by two u
parameter values {u1, u2 } and two v values {v1, v2 }. The vertex locations are determined by
the permutations of these values:


p1 = {u1, v1}
p2 = {u2 , v1}
                                                                                                    (IX.5)
p3 = {u1, v 2 }
p4 = {u2 , v 2 }


We wish to, at least initially, develop grammars which only operate on such orthogonally
oriented rectangles, and whose production rules only result in the generation of such
rectangle. Furthermore, cladding and patterning grammars presume that the field of a
surface under consideration is wholly covered with such rectangular elements, i.e. there are
no gaps in the field or regions where non-rectangular shapes appear. For production rules to



                                                                                                      324
define        a     closure          operator     on
orthogonally oriented rectangles, all
resulting shapes of production rules
in     the    grammar              must     produce
                                                        A
rectangles.


We thus define the closure operators
(addition, subtraction, product) on
rectangles, in such a way that all
                                                        B
compositions of packed rectangles
are     admitted,         and        only   packed
rectangular             configurations            are
produced.           As         a      conventional
                           2
grammar            or     R         shapes        and
boundaries,             problems          begin    to
emerge.


Consider the subtraction operations                     C
shown in Figure IX-36, adhering to
the operations on shapes and their
boundaries as defined by Earl24. The
configuration shown in Figure IX-36A
produces a valid configuration of                       D
rectangles.               However,                the
configuration in Figure IX-36B does
not.     In       order        for     subtraction
operations on rectangles to provide a
closure operator on rectangles, we
may and in fact must define a new
subtraction operation specific to this
class of objects, shown in Figure
IX-36C.           This rule results in the
                                                        E
production of up to four rectangles,
                                                            Figure IX-36: Rectangle subtraction operations
as demonstrated in Figure IX-36D.


                                                                                                         325
Furthermore, the resulting production is ambiguous, since either the resulting top or right
rectangle can extend into the upper right corner.


The most unambiguous resolution of this
condition is to resolve the production into
the (8) possible resulting rectangles, then
draw on subsequent union operations to
select   valid   combinations     of   these                         A. Sum
rectangles, as shown in Figure IX-36E.
We may define the subtraction operation
on rectangles as an operation that takes
an operator and operand rectangles, and
returns (8) rectangles in the configuration                         B. Product
                                                    Figure IX-37: Rectangle Boolean operators
shown    in   Figure   IX-36E,   of    which,
depending on the configuration of the input rectangles, any of the returned rectangles may
be the empty shape ∅.

Similar considerations must be made for the sum operator (+), shown in Figure IX-37A. The
product operator (•, Figure IX-37B) and subshape relation (<) are no different than those on
more general R2 regions and their boundaries.


The Boolean operations on rectangles suggest the definition of alternatives to the subdivision
grammars proposed in Section IX.A. One limitation of the recursive subdivision approach is
that localized, non optimal configurations typically crop up, since each subdivision operates
only on a local region without the possibility of performing operations across these
recursively defined regions. The grammars shown in Figure IX-38 operate in an integer
parametric space I2. Starting with a space populated with rectangle cells of unit side, the
approach selects candidate rectangles to be extended in some direction, as well as
subdivided. Heuristics are applied to determine whether the new configuration is an
improvement on the prior rectangle assembly. This approach can still result in local optima,
but configurations are not rigidly limited by the structuring of prior decisions. In this example,
a simulated annealing approach has been applied, where locally non-optimal changes to the
rectangle organization are stochastically applied, with a probability that decreases over time.

Feature behaviors

Our basic notion of splitting the assembly at
sheet       edges,        introducing      surface
discontinuities at sheet edges (Section
IX.B.2) provides an initial strategy for
surface       rationalization.      In    practical
constructibility applications, it is appropriate
to      imagine        small      scale    surface
discontinuities           between          sheets,
discontinuities    which are        addressed    in
                                                      Figure IX-39: Basic rectangle split operation
fabrication by overlapping sheets. These
discontinuities locally relieve the stress on the surface induced by the macro scale surface
curvature, as described in Section I.A.


Figure IX-39      suggests an extension of this strategy, where the splitting operation is
accompanied by a behavior on rectangle edge features, that attempts to repair the gap
between sheets induced by the combined actions of sheet splitting and localized surface
curvature. We can extend our definition of the rectangle object to accommodate rectangles
with feature behaviors of the types shown in Figure IX-25. Symmetries of these features then
join neighboring rectangles, according to the rules defined in Section IX.B.2


The placement of surface discontinuities in
the     rationalized    surface    assembly     was
identified as the most important mechanism
by which surface rationalization occurs. Our
generative approach needs to include a
strategy that makes best use of these
features in generating a rationalized surface
responding to the design surface. The
previous discussions of surface curvature and
approximations of the surface curvature of            Figure IX-40: Basic rectangle split operation
meshes provide some guidance.




                                                                                                  328
As a point of departure for this discussion,
we consider the implications of design
surface         curvature          on        splitting
discontinuities in the rationalized shape.
Figure IX-41 shows sheets mapped to                      positive curvature       negative curvature

negative curvature. Split continuities are
introduced on the sheet, while the ends
points of the split are bound together. The
identical feature produces opposing effects
                                                                 B. Initial rationalized surface
at   the    discontinuity     (Figure        IX-41C).
Positive curvature surfaces result in the
surface splitting open, and the edges of the
discontinuity    moving       apart     in    space.
Negative curvature results in the edges

overlapping in space. These effects are
most pronounced at the mid point of the
split.


If we are interested in repairing the sheet at
                                                         D.1 adding material     D.2 removing material
the discontinuity, we adjust the split                            Feature adjustment strategy
feature’s shape, by adding material to
close the gap in the positive curvature
case, and removing material to reduce the
overlap in the case negative curvature.
Figure IX-41D shows this strategy in the                              E. Repaired shape

parametric space of the sheet, while Figure              Figure IX-41: Feature generation response to
                                                                    design shape curvature

                    3
configuration in R .


This understanding can be drawn on in if we are interested in inducing curvature into the
shape of the sheet assembly. For conditions where we want to impose positive curvature, we
introduce convex features, bulging outward from the respective boundaries of the sheets on


                                                                                                     329
either side of the feature. For conditions where negative curvature is desired, we introduce a
concave feature pair.


The discussion of gaussian curvature approximation on meshes (Section IX.B.3) provides
the differential geometric analysis of this phenomenon. Consider the sheet conditions at the
vertex of the split feature in Figure IX-41D.1. The interior angles are somewhat less than 180
degrees, in turn the sum of these two angles will be less than 360 degrees, or 2π radians. In
the R3 configuration, the two features are joined together. If we assume negligible angular
deformation of the sheets in R3 the numerator of Equation (IX.2) will be > 0, and the resulting
gaussian curvature κG will be positive. In Figure IX-41D.2, the opposite effect occurs. The
sum of the interior angles is now > 2π, corresponding to a negative curvature condition. At
any other point along the edge the line feature pairs are straight and the angles sum to 2π,
so the numerator (IX.2) – hence the induced gaussian curvature – is 0 . At the ends of the
feature, the angles do not sum to 2π, but these vertices are open along the exterior boundary
of the sheets so the above discussion does not apply. In practice, the material solution will
result in some stretching of the material as a result of the sharp curvature discontinuity at the
mid vertex, and curvature will propagate along the feature to a certain extent.



We may draw on this observation to derive a strategy for
inducing gaussian curvature into the mesh through the
shapes of paired edge features. We sample the gaussian
curvature of the design surface corresponding to the closest
point on the design surface to a given mesh vertex.
Substituting   (IX.3)   into   (IX.2),   using   small    angle
approximation, and drawing on the symmetries of Figure
IX-42, we derive an equation for the induced angle:
       πγ
β≅                                                        (IX.6)
      1+ γ
where
      κGl 2                                                        Figure IX-42: Curvature – angle

mesh regions in the case of positive gaussian curvature, and away from the body of the case
of negative curvature. Figure IX-42 illustrates this strategy.


The constructs defined in this section allow many possible schemes for rationaling surface
assemblies into valied configurations of material sheets. Figure IX-43 shows results of this
approach, where several of subdivision grammars have been applied to test surfaces.

CONCLUSION

This thesis has documented efforts to describe computationally one aspect of Gehry’s
architecture: a set of paper surface forms whose nature is defined by the intersection of a
broad set of aesthetic, material and fabrication intentions. A geometric definition of these
surface forms has been developed within the framework of shape grammars. With this
vocabulary of shapes and operations on shapes defined in a computationally rigorous
manner, it has been possible to develop applications, operating within the space of paper
surface configurations, which automate the solution of certain design and constructibility
problems. This inquiry has deliberately avoided attempting to formalize the more elusive,
evocative elements of Gehry’s design intentions, focusing rather on the design development
decisions regarding the constructibility of forms, for which explicit geometric rules are often
defined. The automation of repetitive, lower level design operations associated with the
propagation of system design decisions across the variations in project geometry is deemed
to be of great value to the firm’s process. At the same time, these rationalization decisions
can have substantial impact on the project design intent, in addition to their more direct
implications on building performance and fabrication economies, and are positioned within
the broad scope of design decisions resulting in the ultimate development of the project form.


It is suggested that this specific inquiry of surface forms is indicative of broader opportunities
for computation in design theory and practice. Gehry’s ambitious formal explorations have
resulted in new vocabularies of architectural forms. In order to realize these forms, explicit
descriptions of these vocabularies must be developed to communicate design intent across
the spectrum of building activities. Digital media present broad new capabilities that can
allow new design intentions to be communicated in a formally rigorous manner.


However, this rewriting of the rules of architectural communication can not be undertaken in
a thoughtless manner. Computing methodologies bring an inherent structure and logic to the
products and processes they support. This explicit structuring renders transparent the
underlying assumptions for their construction, and allows these assumptions to be critically
assessed. At the same time, the definition of any formal descriptive structure unambiguously
not only defines a class of intentions admissible in this framework, but also imposes limits to
intentions admissible in the framework, and by implication suggests a world of possibility for
which the framework has no application. A firm understanding of these qualities of


                                                                                              333
computation, integrated with a rigorous understanding of the conventions and historical
development of building process, must be achieved for computing applications to
appropriately serve design. When computational structures are inappropriately applied, the
structuring of a computational framework limits descriptive capabilities in critical and
disadvantageous ways. Alternatively, when a synergy between the logic of computation and
that of the activities of design is achieved, the result is not simply tools to support existing
processes, but rather the disclosure and critique of the supported process and, perhaps, the
identification of new opportunities and avenues for design.
